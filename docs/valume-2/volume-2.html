<p>The Agurvadya Taila mentioned under &quot;cold fever&quot; if cooked several hundred times alleviates V disorders.</p>

<p>Also, the oils mentioned under Vatarakta for pacification of V should be used by those who desire success.</p>
<p>Ci28#180</p>
<p>There is no remedy for V disorders better than oil [not ghee, but OIL] due to presence of Vyavayi, usna, guru and snigdha [hot, heavy and oily/ slimy] properties.</p>

<p><em>Much information from this chapter has already been entered into book I. The following section has been put into &quot;Treatment of Covering of Doshas, Dhatus and Malas&quot; chart, under Treatment section in Book I.</em></p>
<p><em>Here a page of information was entered under chart &quot;Treatment of Blocked Sub-Vatas and Doshas&quot; on last page of assessment section before Treatment section in Book I.</em></p>
<p><em>The following information should be appended to the information before/after this chart:</em></p>
<p>Prana covers udana etc. and the latter also covers prana. Similarly all others udana etc. cover mutually. Thus there are 20 types of mutual covering of the 5 types of V in stage of aggravation. These should be observed properly.</p>
<p>Ci28#199-200</p>
<p>As general observation, in the state of covering there occurs diminution or aggravation in normal function of these types of V.</p>
<p>Thus the 8 types of covering have been mentioned above broadly with symptoms and treatment for adding to the knowledge of the wise.</p>
<p>Ci28#215-216</p>
<p>The physician should also diagnose the other 12 types of covering of V looking to their location and increase or decrease in functions. Accordingly he should decide the line of treatment and apply massage, intake of uncting substance, enema etc. or hot and cold measures alternately.</p>
<p>Ci28#217-218</p>
<p>...All of them (the Vata sub-types) if not diagnosed properly, continue for a year and neglected or managed improperly become incurable.</p>
<p>Due to neglect of covered Vatas, cardiac disorders, abscess, spleen enlargement, gulma and diarrhea appear as complications. Hence the physician should identify the covering of the 5 types of V by V, P or K and then prescribe the proper remedy for the same.</p>
<p>Ci28#235-237</p>
<p>As in Universe the movement of air, sun and moon is difficult to be known so is that of V, P and K in the body.</p>
<p>Ci28#246</p>
<p>Physician knowing diminution, aggravation, equilibrium and covering of V etc. does not get confused in therapeutic action.</p>

<p>There are 107 vital parts [These later get used for &#x27;marma chikitsa&#x27;] in the body located in the trunk and extremities. -Si9#3</p>
<p>In case of affliction in any of them there is excruciating pain because of the specific attachment of consciousness to them. Si9#3</p>
<p>Of them those located in the trunk are more important than those located in the extremities because the latter are dependent on the former. Si9#3</p>
<p>Of them also the hrt (heart), basti (urinary bladder) and siras (head) are important ones because they are roots of the body.</p>
<p>Si9#3</p>
<p>In the heart, 10 dhamanis (vessels), prana and apana, mind, intellect, consciousness and mahabhutas are established as spokes in the hub.</p>
<p>Si9#4</p>
<p>In the head, senses, channels carrying them [nerves] and vital breath are located as rays in the sun [as sun-rays emanate from the sun].</p>
<p>Si9#4</p>
<p>Basti situated in the middle of rectum, scrotum, &#x27;raphe&#x27; [?], vas deferens and ureters is receptacle of urine and stabilizer of all the fluid-carrying channels, just as the sea is the receptacle of all the rivers.</p>
<p>Si9#4</p>
<p>By numerous channels known as vital parts rooted to the above the body is pervaded like the sky by the sun rays.</p>
<p>Si9#5</p>
<p>By breaking of any of the above 3 the body is broken quickly because by destruction of substratum the dependent is also destroyed.</p>
<p>Si9#5</p>
<p>By their affliction, there is appearance of severe disorders.</p>
<p>Hence these should be protected particularly from external injury as well as the doshas (internal factors).</p>
<p>Si9#5</p>
<p>Symptoms When the heart is afflicted:</p>
<p>cough, dyspnea, debility, dryness of throat, traction of kloma, protraction of tongue, dryness of mouth and throat, epilepsy, insanity, delirium, vacantness of mind. Si9#6</p>
<p>Symptoms When the Head is Afflicted:</p>
<p>stiffness of carotid regions, facial paralysis, rolling of eye balls, mental confusion, cramps, loss of movement, cough, dyspnea, lock-jaw, muteness, stammering, &#x27;ptosis&#x27;, quivering of cheeks, yawning, salivation, loss of voice, crooked-ness of face etc.</p>
<p>Si9#6</p>
<p>Symptoms When Basti if Afflicted:</p>
<p>retention of flatus, urine and feces; pain in groin, penis and urinary bladder, kundala, udavarta, gulma, vatasthila, upastambha (stiffness), spasm in navel, lower abdomen, anus and hip.</p>
<p>Si9#6</p>
<p>Symptoms along with treatment of these affected with the dosas have already been said in the section on therapeutics. (Ch. 2).</p>
<p>Si9#6</p>
<p>However, these should be protected particularly from V.</p>
<p>V is the cause of aggravation of P and K and is also the root cause of vital breath.</p>
<p>That again is most amenable to enema therapy.</p>
<p>Hence there is no other therapy equal to enema for protecting the vital parts.</p>
<p>So in order to protect the great vital parts one should administer the 6 groups of (drugs used in ) unctuous enema as said in Vimanasthana and the formulations of enema mentioned here and other remedies applicable in V disorders after considering carefully.</p>

<p>The Vital Breath of men resides in the heart, head and urinary bladder.</p>
<p>Hence one should make every effort to protect them.</p>
<p>Si9#9</p>
<p>The protection of vital parts consists of avoidance of impending factors, observance of the code of conduct for the healthy and remedy of disorders if arisen.</p>
<p>Si9#10</p>
<p>Hereafter will be described some of the disorders of the vital parts which are not said in the chapter on treatment of the same (Ci. 26) along with their remedy:</p>
<p>Si9#11</p>
<p>Symptoms of &#x27;Apatantraka&#x27;:</p>
<p>V vitiated by it&#x27;s own aggravating factors moves upwards from it&#x27;s place reaching the heart and then head and temples, afflicts them and bends the body like a bow, causes convulsions and mental confusion.</p>
<p>The patient breathes with difficulty, has stiff and closed eyes, loses consciousness and groans like a pigeon.</p>
<p>This is known as &#x27;Apatantraka&#x27;.</p>
<p>Si9#12-13</p>
<p>Symptoms of &#x27;Apatanaka&#x27;:</p>
<p>Causing fixed vision and unconsciousness it makes the patients groan.</p>
<p>When the heart is freed he become normal and again gets unconsciousness when it is covered.</p>
<p>This severe condition caused by V is said by some as apatanaka.</p>
<p>Si914-15</p>
<p>One should cleanse the channels obstructed by K and V with irritant blowings thus when the obstructions are removed, the patient regains consciousness.</p>
<p>Si9#16</p>
<p>One should also use the fine powder of marica, seeds of sigru, vidanga and phanijjhaka as head-evacuation. - Si9#17</p>
<p>(The powder of) tumburu, haritaki, hingu, puskaramula, 3 salts should be taken with water boiled with barley in affliction of heart and apatantraka.</p>
<p>Si9#18</p>
<p>Hingu, amlavetasa, sunthi, sauvarcala and pomegranate should be taken. Si9#19</p>
<p>Besides, other measures alleviating V and K and heart disease are beneficial. Si9#19</p>
<p>The drastic evacuative enema are not wholesome for the patient wholly. Hence ghrta cooked with sauvarcala, haritake and trikatu should be given. Si9#20</p>
<p>When due to regular intake of sweet, unctuous and heavy food, mental work, physical exertion, anxiety and chronic illness K impelled by V overpowers the heart and obstructs intellect etc. located there, stupor arises.</p>
<p>Restlessness in heart, heaviness in speech, movements and senses and unpleasantness in mind and intellect– these are the features of stupor. -#21-23</p>
<p>This should be managed with K-alleviating evacuation, pacificatory measures, physical exercise, blood-letting and diet consisting of pungents and bitters.</p>
<p>Si9#24</p>
<p>Mutraukasada, mutrajathara, mutrakrcchra, mutrotsanga, mutrasamksaya, mutratita, vatasthila, vatabasti, usnavata, vatakundalika, granthi, vidghata and bastikundala— these are 13 disorders of urine.</p>

<p>Si9#(27-) 32-43</p>
<p>When P is associated there are: burning sensation, pain and abnormal colors in the urine.</p>
<p>Si9#44</p>
<p>When K is associated there is: heaviness, swelling and urine as unctuous, precipitant and white.</p>
<p>Si9#45</p>
<p>Prognosis: The condition of urinary bladder with obstruction of it&#x27;s duct by K</p>
<p>and aggravation of P is incurable.</p>
<p>Si9#46</p>
<p>The condition where the duct is not obstructed and coiling is</p>
<p>absent is curable.</p>
<p>Si9#47</p>
<p>In conditions of coiling of urinary bladder thirst; fainting and dyspnea arise.&#x27; Si9#48</p>
<p>Looking to the predominance of doshas, these should be treated with diuretics. Si9#49</p>
<p>Enema and urethral douche should be given in all of these cases. Si9#49</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="urethral-enema">Urethral Enema:<a href="#urethral-enema" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Urethral Enema:" title="Direct link to Urethral Enema:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Specifications for Uretheral Enema Equipment:</p>
<p>The catheter of the urethral douche should be made of: gold or silver.</p>
<p>It should be smooth, of diameter equal to that of jasmine or oleander flower, tapering like cow&#x27;s tale, with hole fitting to the mustard seed, having 2 ears and 12 fingers in length.</p>
<p>This should be fitted to goat&#x27;s urinary bladder.</p>
<p>Si9#50-51</p>
<p>Administration of Urethral Enema:</p>
<p>With this the uncting substance in the dose of 20gm or so according to age should be introduced.</p>
<p>This should be applied to a person having taken a bath and food with meat soup or milk, having passed the urges of feces and urine and seated comfortably and straight on a soft, knee-high seat.</p>
<p>His penis should be made erect and a probe smeared with ghee is inserted to see of the passage is unobstructed.</p>
<p>Then the catheter of the size of penis should be introduced into urethra parallel to the &#x27;perineal raphe&#x27; like (enema nozzle) in anus.</p>
<p>If over-inserted it may injure the urinary bladder and on the other hand if underinserted the uncting substance may not reach there.</p>
<p>Thus pressing easily without shaking the catheter should be taken out.</p>
<p>After it comes back, the second and third one should be given (in like manner). If it does not come back it should be ignored till night is passed.</p>
<p>Si9#52-57</p>
<p>Pippali, salt, soot, apamarga, mustard, juice of vartaka, nirgundi, aragvadha and sahacara pounded with cow&#x27;s urine and sour liquid along with jaggery are made into a suppository which are should be inserted into the urethra. [!]</p>
<p>This suppository should be the size of the mustard on the tip and of black gram in the latter half; it&#x27;s length should be equal to that of the catheter, it should be smeared with ghee, should be soft but unbreakable.</p>
<p>** For urethra it should be like catheter but for anus it should be size of thumb.</p>
<p>Si9#58-60 [the above line is a general rule. Spell out.]</p>
<p>When the uncting substance comes back, the management, restrictions, complications and signs of proper application are like those in unctuous enema.</p>
<p>Si9#61</p>
<p>Administration for Women During Menstruation:</p>
<p>&quot;This remedial measure should be applied in case of women during the period of menstruation because at that time the uterus is devoid of covering and as such receives the unction easily thus V having been overcome conception in uterus takes place quickly.</p>
<p>Besides, vaginal douche processed with respective drugs should be given in disorders of urinary bladder, prolapse of uterus, severe pain in genital track, disorders of genital track, menorrhagia, retention or incontinence of urine.&quot;</p>
<p>Si9#62-64</p>
<p>Urethral Enema for Women:</p>
<p>Administration of Urethral Enema for Women:</p>
<p>In case of women, the catheter should be 10 fingers long, with circumference like that of urethral canal in which the grain of green gram may pass on.</p>
<p>In genital track, it should be inserted up to 4 fingers,</p>
<p>while in urethra upto 2 fingers</p>
<p>and 1 finger in female child</p>
<p>It should be inserted parallel to the vertebral column.</p>
<p>[The catheter itself should be 10 fingers long, for ease of reach and use, but is never inserted more than 4 fingers (vagina) or 2 fingers (urethra).]</p>
<p>Si9#65-66</p>
<p>Administration of Urethral Enema for Women:</p>
<p>The catheter should be inserted easily while she is lying in supine position, flexing her legs fully.</p>
<p>Thus the unction should be given through douche twice, thrice or 4 times in 24 hours.</p>
<p>After the douche is given, suppository somewhat thicker should be inserted. In this way, the treatment should be continued for 3 days gradually increasing the dose of uncting substance.</p>
<p>This should be repeated after 3 days in the same manner. Si9#67-69</p>

<p>Rakta, P and V when vitiated are spread to the temple region and cause severe swelling with intense pain, burning sensation and redness.</p>
<p>This having intensity like that of poison blocks the head and throat quickly and kills the patient within 3 days.</p>
<p>This is named as &#x27;sankhaka&#x27;.</p>
<p>If the patient survives after 3 days the treatment consisting of head-evacuation, sprinkling etc. and other anti-erysipelas measures should be given after declaring the incurability of the disease.</p>
<p>Si9#70-73</p>
<p>V vitiated due to intake of rough food, over-eating, eating during indigestion, exposure to easterly wind and dews, excessive coitus, suppression of urges, exertion and physical exercise singly or accompanied by K seizes the half of the head and then produces severe pain like cutting and churning in half of the carotid region, eyebrow, temple, ear, eye and forehead.</p>
<p>This is &#x27;ardhavabhedaka&#x27;.</p>
<p>If it is far advanced, it may destroy sight and hearing.</p>
<p>Si9#74-76</p>
<p>In this condition, maximum dose of 4 fats, head evacuation, purgation, tubular fomentation, old ghee, enema, unctuous enema, upanaha (poultice), cranial pouch and cauterization are commended along with other measures prescribed in coryza and cranial disorders.</p>
<p>Si9#77-78</p>
<p>Due to suppression of urge, indigestion etc. blood and V get vitiated and then affect the brain which thus affected is gradually liquefied after sunrise due to heat of the sun-rays and headache increases as the day advances and gets subsided at the end of the day when the brain matter is solidified. This is &#x27;suryavarta&#x27;.</p>
<p>Si9#79-80</p>
<p>In this condition, intake of ghee after meals, head-evacuation, purgation, application of 3 fats on head, poultice (on head) with meat of wild animals and sprinkling with ghee and milk should be applied.</p>
<p>Moreover, ghee extracted from the milk boiled with peacock, partridge, common quail, etc. and processed with the (paste of) vitalizer drugs and 8 times milk should be given as snuff.</p>
<p>Si9#81-83</p>
<p>Due to indulgence in fasting, grief, rough, cold and little food, the 3 dosas get vitiated and cause intense pain in carotid regions and back neck which stays in eyebrows and temples.</p>
<p>It also causes twitching near the cheeks, eye diseases and lock jaw. This is &#x27;anantavata&#x27;.</p>
<p>Si9#84-85</p>
<p>This should be treated with venesection and other measures prescribed in Suryavarta.</p>
<p>Si9#86</p>
<p>V vitiated by the use of rough etc. causes trembling of the head.</p>
<p>This should be treated with the uncting substance processed with guduci, gala, rasna, mahasveta and asvagandha, unction and sudation and saturation snuffing. - Si9#87</p>

<p>Etiology, Symptoms and Consequences of Udavarta (upward movement of V): If apana V in colon gets vitiated due to intake of astringent, bitter, pungent and rough food; suppression of urges, fasting and coitus, it creates obstruction in lower passages because of strength and causes retention of feces, flatus and urine and finally severe udavarta (upward movement of V).</p>
<p>Because of this there starts intense and frequent pain in pelvis, cardiac region, sides and front of abdomen, back and sides of chest.</p>
<p>Besides, due to obstruction in apana V, there are tympanitis, nausea, cutting pain, piercing pain, indigestion, cystitis, retention of stool, enlargement of mesenteric glands and upward movement of V; stool is passed with difficulty, as dry and with delay, body becomes coarse, rough and cold [and] consequently disorders such as fever, dysuria, dysentery, cardiac disorders, grahani disorder, vomiting, blindness, deafness, headache, vatodara, vatasthila, mental disorders, thirst, internal hemorrhage, anorexia, gulma, cough, dyspnea, coryza, facial paralysis and chest pain arise.</p>

<p>The person urinates with difficulty.</p>
<p>Ci26#28</p>
<p>Signs of V dysuria:</p>
<p>there is severe pain in groins, pelvis and penis and the patient passes urine scanty and frequently.</p>
<p>Ci26#29</p>
<p>Signs of P dysuria:</p>
<p>the patient passes yellow or bloody urine with pain and burning sensation frequently and with difficulty.</p>

<p>When V dries up semen or urine, P or K, the calculus arises gradually like gall stone in cow.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="calculus">Calculus:<a href="#calculus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Calculus:" title="Direct link to Calculus:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>When the calculus simulating kadamba flower, stiny, smooth, prismatic or soft comes in the passage of urine, it obstructs the flow of urine and thus causes pain in bladder.</p>
<p>Urine is passed in divided streams and with pain in suture [ureters], penis and bladder.</p>
<p>The patient, with agonizing pain, presses the penis and sometimes passes stool and sometimes urine.</p>
<p>If the passage or bladder is injured by irritation of calculus urine is passed with blood (hematuria).</p>
<p>When calculus shifts from the passage, the patient passes urine with ease.</p>
<p>Ci26#32-33</p>
<p>Sarkara (gravels):</p>
<p>When the calculus is disintegrated by V and comes out of the urinary passage it is known as Sarkara (gravels).</p>
<p>Ci26#34</p>
<p>Blocked discharge of Semen:</p>
<p>Discharge of semen checked by dosas separately situated in urinary bladder produce pain in penis and pelvis, difficult passing of urine mixed with semen.</p>
<p>The patient&#x27;s pelvis as well as testicles get stiffened, swollen and intensely painful.</p>
<p>Ci26#35</p>
<p>[Cystic Hemolith]:</p>
<p>Due to cut or injury or loss (of semen) blood discharged within the urinary bladder is bound up and causing agonizing pain is converted into a calculus after combining with urine.</p>
<p>When it is accumulated too much there are inflation and heaviness in urinary bladder which is relieved after the calculus passes out.</p>

<h1>The significance of Agni (digestive fire):</h1>
<p>Life-span, complexion, strength, health, enthusiasm, corpulence, lustre, immunity, energy, heat processes and vital breath- all these depend on body fire.</p>
<p>One dies if this fire is extinguished, lives long free from disorders if it is functioning properly, gets ill if it is deranged, hence Agni is the root cause of all.</p>
<p>Ci15#3-4</p>
<p>Food can only nourish the dhatus, ojas, strength, complexion etc. by the help of Agni because these things (the dhatus, etc.) can&#x27;t be produced by undigested food.</p>

<p>Prana Vayu (which has receiving function) carries the food to the belly where the food gets disintegrated by fluids (juices) and softened by fatty substances, then gets acted upon by the digestive fire fanned by Samana V.</p>
<p>Thus the digestive fire cooks the timely taken and balanced food properly, leading to promotion of lifespan.</p>
<p>Agni cooks from below the food situated in the stomach for division into rasa (nutritive factor) and mala (excretion) as the same cooks the rice grains with water kept in a vessel into boiled rice.</p>

<p>The food composed of 6 rasas immediately after it is ingested undergoes the stages of &quot;prapaka&quot; (preliminary digestion).</p>
<p>Firstly, due to predominance of sweetness K (mucus secretion) of frothy character arises.</p>
<p>Thereafter during the process of digestion when the food is half-burnt and descending from the stomach due to predominance of acidity P (the bile and other digestive factors) comes forth freely.</p>
<p>Lastly when it reaches the large intestines, it is absorbed by fire and gets converted into a solid mass, V (wind) is formed due to predominance of pungency.</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;...the disciple submitted thus- &quot;How is rakta originated in the body from dissimilar rasa which does not have red colour, and how does it acquire redness? How does the solid flesh (mamsa) originate from the liquid blood (rakta)? How is the origin of medas (fat) from the liquid blood and solid flesh? How is there hardness in bones which are originated from the soft tissues muscle and fat? How does the unctuous and soft marrow arise within the hard bones? Sukra is said to be the product of majja but how does the semen pervading the entire body come out of the marrow situated inside the bone when there are no holes in the bone?&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;The teacher having been requested thus by the disciple answered as follows: &quot;Rasa, the essence of food, acquires redness from the colour of the firelike P.</p>
<p>The same acted upon by vayu, ap and tejas and cooked by it&#x27;s own heat and being predominated by it&#x27;s own heat, ap and unctuous properties is converted into medas.</p>
<p>Further the innate heat combining prthivi, tejas, vayu, etc. together gives rise to hardness and thus produces asthi.</p>
<p>Within the bones vayu creates hollowness which is filled up by the marrow, the essence of medas.</p>
<p>From the essence of marrow, semen is produced.</p>
<p>By vayu, akasa etc. porousness is produced in bones through which semen comes out like water from the new earthen jar. Semen moves through it&#x27;s carrying vessels in the whole body and propelled with force from sexual ecstasy and passionate determination gets displaced and liquefied like ghee by physical exertion comes out of the urinary passage like water flowing towards the lower surface (?).&quot;&quot; Ci15#22-35</p>

<p>Ci15#38-41</p>
<h1>Section on Description of Disorders of Grahani:</h1>
<h1>The 3 Wrong Eating Habits:</h1>
<p>These 3 cause death or severe disorders:</p>
<p>Samasana: eating wholesome and unwholesome food items mixed together.</p>
<p>Visamasana: eating more or less than the proper amount to eat, or before or after the proper time to eat.</p>
<p>Adhyasana: eating while the previous meal is still undigested.</p>
<p>Ci15#235-237 [perhaps provide examples for the above.]</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="difference-in-over-eating-at-the-day-meal-versus-the-night-meal">Difference in over-eating at the Day meal versus the Night meal:<a href="#difference-in-over-eating-at-the-day-meal-versus-the-night-meal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Difference in over-eating at the Day meal versus the Night meal:" title="Direct link to Difference in over-eating at the Day meal versus the Night meal:" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Even on indigestion of the day meal [lunch] the night meal [supper] is not disturbing.</p>
<p>[In other words, even eating too much during lunch will not prevent digestion of supper.]</p>
<p>The reason is that during the day the heart is blossomed like a lotus [open] and because of this all channels remain clear.</p>
<p>Moreover, due to physical exertion, movements and mental activities the dhatus do not get moistened during the day.</p>
<p>So on other food added to the unmoistened previous one does not get effected and becomes homogeneous like fresh milk mixed with un-spoiled milk.</p>
<p>On the contrary, during the night the heart is faded, the channels are covered and the belly is obstructed and consequently the dhatus get moistened.</p>
<p>Another food added while the undigested material is moistened gets affected like hot milk added to spoiled milk.</p>
<p>Hence the wise person in order to protect his strength and life-span should never eat anything if the food taken in night is still undigested. [This goes for late-night snack as well as breakfast or even lunch the next day.]</p>
<p>Ci15#238-243</p>
<h1>Causes of Deranged Agni:</h1>
<p>fasting, eating during indigestion, over-eating, irregular eating, intake of unsuitable, heavy, cold, too rough and contaminated food, faulty administration of emesis, purgation and unction, emaciation due to some disease, faulty adaptation to place, time and seasons and suppression of natural urges.</p>
<p>Agni thus deranged becomes unable to digest even the light food and the food being undigested gets acidified and toxic.</p>

<p>When combined with K it gives rise to phthisis, coryza, prameha etc. and other K disorders.</p>

<p>frequent pain in sides, thighs, groins and neck, visucika (piercing pain in abdomen), cardiac pain, emaciation, debility, abnormal taste in mouth, cutting pain in abdomen, greed for every food item, lassitude, tympanitis during and after digestion subsiding after taking meal, suspicion of vatagulma, heart disease or splenomegaly arise.</p>

<p>Because of sweet vipaka, it does not vitiate P, is wholesome in K and due to astringent, hot, vikassi (depressant) and rough properties and in V due to sweet, sour and viscous nature (thus it is useful in all 3 doshas).</p>

<h1>Use of Fat/ Oil to Kindle Agni:</h1>
<p>Sneha (fat) is excellent as a stimulant of weak fire.</p>
<p>Even much heavy food is not able to pacify the fire kindled by fat.</p>
<p>Hence one passing undigested diarrheic stools due to deficient agni should take adequate dose of ghrta <em>mixed with appetising drugs</em>.</p>
<p>The Mechanism by Which Fat/ Oil Kindles Agni:</p>
<p>By this the samana V being normalised and positioned in its normal passage and due to it&#x27;s movement nearby improves the power of agni <em>quickly</em>.</p>
<p>One who passes stool with difficulty due to hardness should take ghee in ample quantity added with salt in mid-meal.</p>

<p>Buttermilk, if fresh [not fermented?], does not produce burning (or acidity).</p>

<p>The digestive fire is stimulated by neither fasting nor over-eating.</p>
<p>( For example, a fire without kindling, or covered with excessive kindling gets extinguished.)</p>
<p>The power of agni increases with the intake of:</p>
<p>unctuous food</p>
<p>various powders and</p>
<p>aristas</p>
<p>As fire with the fuel of heartwood is stable and lasts for long, the internal fire is stabilized by the application of unctuous food.</p>
<p>One enjoys health for long by taking wholesome diet in proper quantity and after the previous food is digested.</p>
<p>&quot;One should be careful to promote the agni by [not] disturbing the equilibrium of the dhatus.&quot;</p>
<p>When the doshas are in equilibrium the heat of agni &#x27;located in the mid-portion of the body&#x27; is also normal and the food digested by it leads to promotion of health, corpulence, life-span and strength. If agni becomes deficient or excessive due to imbalanced dosas, it causes disorders.</p>

<p>Administer heavy, unctuous, cold, sweet and slimy food and drinks.</p>
<p>(These act like pouring water on fire.)</p>
<p>Even on indigestion he should be fed frequently so that agni without fuel may not get opportunity to kill him [(by breaking down the dhatus)].</p>
<p>The patient should eat rice cooked in milk, rice cooked with pulse, fatty and floury preparations, products of jaggery, fatty meat of aquatic and marshy animals.</p>
<p>One should eat fishes particularly smooth and moving in still water and fatty mutton which destroys the excessive fire.</p>
<p>While hungry he should take gruel mixed with bee&#x27;s wax or drink ghee.</p>
<p>Or after venesection he should take churned drink of wheat four [mantha] or milk boiled with sugar, ghee and vitalizer drugs.</p>
<p>The bolus of powdered oily fruits [dates, figs, etc.] added with sugar and fatty meat soups make the fire mild.</p>
<p>The patient should drink ghee mixed with bee&#x27;s wax followed by cold water or wheat flour mixed with ghee followed by milk.</p>
<p>Or he should take three fats (except oil) processed with the meat juice of marshy animals or solid preparations made of fine wheat flour mixed with the 3 fats with milk.</p>
<p>One should take the bark of udumbara mixed with woman&#x27;s breast milk or payasa (rice cooked with milk) prepared with these 2.</p>
<p>The patient should be subjected to frequent purgation with milk boiled with syama and trivrt for eliminating the excess of P giving the diet of rice cooked with milk.</p>
<p>The wise physician considering all the aspects should administer the above measures.</p>
<p>Whatever food is sweet, fatty, K-aggravating and heavy is entirely wholesome for the patient of excessive fire along with day-sleep after meal.</p>
<p>The patient who without going into fainting takes fatty diet in excessive fire does not fall a prey to the possible disorders, but on the contrary, attains corpulence.</p>
<p>When K is increased, P along with V is overcome, the normalized fire in one having balanced dhatus digests the food leading to promotion of corpulence, life-span and strength. Ci15#221-234</p>

<p>The following &quot;puranic&quot; myth full of passionate indulgence about the moon was heard by the sages from the conversing gods abiding in the heaven. The body of the moon because of excessive attachment to Rohini [a god? a food?] was reduced to loss of unctuousness and his carelessness to protection of health. Due to non-enjoyment with the other daughters Prajapati (the lord of progeny) became furious and his anger came out of his mouth in embodiment through expiration. The moon wedded the 28 daughters of the lord of progeny but did not deal with all equally. Thus despised by the great, treating his wives unequally, filled up with rajas and debility the moon was attacked by yaksma (phthisis).</p>
<p>Having been overcome by the severe anger of the great, the lustreless moon went to the refuge of the great accompanied by gods and godly sages. Now, the lord of progeny, knowing the pure mind of the moon, was pleased and as such he was treated by Asvins.</p>
<p>Thus, the moon, having been freed from the obstacles, and having increase of Ojas from Asvins attained particular splendor and pure psyche.</p>

<p>That over-exertion is one of the causes of phtisis will be explained further.</p>
<p>When a weak person fights against a strong one,</p>
<p>or exercises with an excessively big bow,</p>
<p>or speaks too much</p>
<p>or carries excessive weight,</p>
<p>or swims across a long distance in water,</p>
<p>or is habitually subjected to forceful anointing and kneading with feet,</p>
<p>or travels fast to a long distance</p>
<p>or is assaulted</p>
<p>or when a person takes up battle, reading, weight-lifting, traveling on foot, leaping, jumping etc or falls down or has injury, or other exertive actions or actions disproportionate to strength or complicated actions</p>
<p>... his lungs/ chest is wounded due to excessive effort and V having been vitiated aggravates the other 2 doshas and runs here and there in the body. -Ni6#4, Ci8#14-16</p>
<p>Situated in the head, it causes headache;</p>
<p>in the throat, it causes irritation in throat, cough, hoarseness of voice and anorexia</p>
<p>in the sides, it causes pain in sides,</p>
<p>in the rectum, it causes diarrhea</p>
<p>in the joints, it causes yawning and fever</p>
<p>in the chest, it causes chest pain</p>
<p>Due to wound in chest:</p>
<p>The patient on coughing expels sputum with blood (hemoptysis) from the hollow chest with difficulty experiencing severe pain in chest.</p>
<p>Thus the phthisis caused by &quot;over-reaction&quot; [over-exertion] is associated with the above eleven symptoms.</p>
<p>Ci8#14-19</p>
<p>Again, due to the above forms of over-exertion, V gets aggravated in the lung wound and located there it takes along K residing in lungs and also affects P and spreads upwards, downwards and obliquely.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s portion which enters into the body joints gives rise to yawning, body-ache and fever.</p>
<p>That which goes to amasaya produces disease of lungs and anorexia; that which goes to the throat produces irritation of throat and hoarseness of voice;</p>
<p>that which goes into the channels carrying vital breath causes dyspena and coryza;</p>
<p>that which is located in head produces distress in head, thus due to wound in lungs, irregular movement of V and irritation of throat, cough arises frequently and because of this lungs having been wounded further hemoptysis starts, and consequently the patient becomes weak.</p>
<p>Thus these complications due to over-exertion afflict the person indulged in it. Further because of having been afflicted with these wasting complications, he gradually falls a prey to phtisis.</p>
<p>Hence the wise should take up works considering and commensurate to his strength because the body is dependent on strength and the person basically consists of the body.</p>
<p>Ni6#4</p>
<p>One should abstain from over-exertive action in order to protect his life because he will be able to enjoy the desired fruits of the action only if he lives. [a little humor!] Ni6#5</p>

<p>When due to bashfulness, or disgust, or fear one suppresses the impelled urge of flatus, urine and feces, V, due to obstruction of the impulse propels K and P upwards,</p>
<p>obliquely and downwards and thus produces the disorders having symptoms of all the 3 doshas such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>coryza, cough, hoarseness of voice, anorexia, pain in sides, headache, fever, pain in shoulders, body-ache, frequent vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the eleven symptoms on account of which the disease is called as great.</p>
<p>Ci8#20-23</p>
<p>Again, that suppression of natural urges is a cause of phthisis will be explained further.</p>
<p>When a person checks the impelled urges of flatus, urine and feces because of attending the king, the master or the preceptors or having joined the society of gambling and nobles in the midst of women;</p>
<p>or while traveling on uneven vehicle;</p>
<p>due to fear, environment, bashfulness or disgust,</p>
<p>... V gets vitiated due to suppression of urges.</p>
<p>Ni6#6</p>
<p>This vitiated V aggravating P and K spreads upwards, downwards and obliquely. Then, as said earlier, with a portion entering into the specific body parts gives rise to pain, diarrhea or drying up of feces, excessive pain in sides (of chest), pain in shoulder, irritation in throat and lungs, headache, cough, dyspnea, fever, hoarseness of voice and</p>
<p>coryza;</p>
<p>then having been afflicted with these wasting complications, the patient gradually becomes a victim of phthisis.</p>
<p>Hence the wise should be particularly careful in observing the ways which promote and protect the body;</p>
<p>body is their substratum and also the base of the person. - Ni6#6</p>

<p>Phthisis due to wasting leads to loss of life.</p>
<p>Excessive reducing due to envy, eagerness, fever, terror, anger and grief and excessive indulgence in sexual intercourse and fasting lead to loss of semen and ojas.</p>
<p>This in turn, due to loss of unctuousness, vitiates V which further aggravates the other 2 doshas and produces these 11 symptoms such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>coryza, fever, cough, bodyache, headache, dyspnea, diarrhea, anorexia, pain in sides, feeble voice and distress in shoulders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ci8#24-27</p>
<p>That wasting is the cause of phthisis will be explained further.</p>
<p>When a person is invaded excessively at the heart by anxiety and grief; or by envy, ambitions, fear, anger, etc; or while being emaciated uses rough food and drinks; or weak by birth is subjected to fasting or malnutrition, his rasa residing in heart gets</p>
<p>diminished and because of this he acquires phthisis.</p>
<p>In case of want of (proper) management, he gets associated with the disease having symptoms to be described later.</p>
<p>Ni6#7.1</p>
<p>Or when a person due to excessive passion and with excessive attachment to woman indulges in excessive sexual intercourse, his semen gets diminished because of this.</p>
<p>In spite of semen being diminished, if his mind is not detracted from women, and he is further engaged in sexual act with excessively determined passion, his semen is not discharged because of it&#x27;s already diminished state so due to physical exertion (during coitus) V enters into the blood vessels and causes blood discharged from them which comes out of the seminal passage, due to loss of semen, along with the symptoms of V.</p>
<p>Now, due to the loss of semen and hemorrhage, his joints become loose, roughness appears, body becomes further weak and V gets vitiated.</p>
<p>The vitiated V spreading in the body devoid of semen and blood and aggravating K and P dries up muscles and blood, expels K and P, causes pain in sides (of chest) and shoulders, irritation in throat, aggravating the K of head, refills it with K, causing pain in joints produces body-ache, anorexia and indigestion, due to stirring up of P and K and taking opposite course V gives rise to fever, cough, dyspnea, hoarseness of voice and coryza.</p>
<p>Due to frequent cough, the lungs are injured and hemoptysis ensues, consequently the patient suffers from debility and having been afflicted with these wasting complications he gradually becomes a victim of phthisis.</p>
<p>Hence the wise protecting his body should protect his semen because it is the final product of food. - Ni6#8</p>
<p>Semen is the best essence of one&#x27;s food, hence it should be protected because it&#x27;s diminution leads to many diseases or even death.</p>
<p>Ni6#9</p>
<p>*** That irregular dieting is a cause of phthisis will be explained further.</p>
<p>When a person takes usually the food– drinkable, eatable, chewable and lickable– irregularly in terms of nature, preparation, combination, quantity, place, time, rules for dietetic use and suitability, his V, P and K attain imbalance.</p>
<p>** These imbalanced dosas spreading in the body when they stay obstructing the openings of channels whatever food he takes is mostly transformed into urine and feces only and not so into other dhatus.</p>
<p>In this stage he continues on the support of feces, hence feces should be protected particularly in case of the person suffering from phthisis and also of that who is too much lean and weak.</p>
<p>In him devoid of nourishment, dosas aggravated due to irregular dieting produce respective complications and lead to further degradation.</p>
<p>V causes pain, body-ache, irritation of throat, chest pain, pain in shoulders, hoarseness of voice and coryza, P causes fever, diarrhea, internal heat and K produces coryza, heaviness of head, anorexia and cough.</p>
<p>Due to frequent cough lungs are injured and hemoptysis ensues and consequently</p>
<p>debility arises.</p>
<p>Thus these 3 dosas aggravated by irregular dieting produce phthisis.</p>
<p>Having been afflicted with these wasting complications, the patient gradually dries up.</p>
<p>Hence the wise should take food which is not irregular in terms of nature, preparation, combination, quantity, place, time, rules of dietetic use and suitability.</p>
<p>The wise person, heedful of the many troublesome diseases caused by irregular dieting, should eat wholesome, measured and timely food with self-restraint.</p>

<p>In a person taking various foods and drinks irregularly, the doshas produces severe and difficult disorders.</p>

<p>By regular use of these 4 etiological factors of phthisis V, P and K get vitiated. These vitiated dosas dry up the body with various complications.</p>

<p>&quot;Dhatus get metabolized by their respective agni and are nourished by their respective channels.&quot; (Duplicate/ Move this note to the section on Dhatus).</p>
<p>Rajayaksma takes place due to blocked channels, loss of blood etc. and decrease of dhatuagnis.</p>
<p>During this period whatever food in the gastro-intestinal tract is digested by (jathara) agni is converted mostly to malas and only a little is utilized for ojas.</p>
<p>Hence the stool in the patient of rajayaksma should be cared for particularly because in the state of the wasting of all the dhatus, the strength of the stool supports the body. *****</p>
<p>Rasa, because of blocking of channels, accumulates in it&#x27;s own place and comes out with the impulse of cough in various forms.</p>

<p>The patients who are drying up and emaciated should be given well-prepared meats of carnivorous animals which are particularly bulk-promoting.</p>
<p>The meat of peacock should be given to the patient of phthisis and in the name of peacock methodically well-prepared meat of vultures, owls, and blue jay should be given.</p>
<p>Likewise, crow should be given to the patient in the name of partridge, serpents in the name of snakefish and fried earthworms in the name of intenstines of fish.</p>
<p>The physician should get meat of fox, large mongoose, cats and jackal-cubs served in the name of rabbit.</p>
<p>One should give the meat of lion, bear, hyena, tiger and other similar carnivorous animals in the name of deer for increasing flesh.</p>
<p>The physician should give the well-spiced meat of elephant, rhinocerous and horse in the name of buffalo for increasing flesh.</p>
<p>The meat of animals nourished on meat only of animals and birds is an excellent flesh-promoting due to it&#x27;s being sharp, hot and light.</p>
<p>The pretext is only taken resort to in cases of undesirable meats which are not in practice because in that way they can be eaten easily.</p>
<p>In case the patient comes to know the reality and is disgusted he should not eat it or vomit if already eaten.</p>
<p>Hence there is advice of giving these meats by way of pretext.</p>
<p>The meats of peacock, partridge, cock, swan, boar, camel, ass, cow and buffalo are excellent flesh-promoting.</p>
<p>In chapter on food and drinks (Su, 27), the 8-fold source of meats has been described.</p>
<p>From these the physician should select and give the suitable meat to the patient of phthisis.</p>
<p>Animals and birds which are snatchers, burrow-dwellers, living in marshy land and water, as moving in water should be given in diet in proper quantity to the patient of &quot;vatika sosa&quot;.</p>
<p>Animals and birds which are peckers, gallinaceous and live in forest should be given to the patient of phthisis having predominance of K and P.</p>
<p>These meats which are to be eaten should be well-prepared by prescribed method, favorable, soft, juicy and having good aroma.</p>
<p>By keeping on meat diet, drinking wine after meals and having firm and broad mind, phthisis does not stay in the body for long.</p>
<p>Phthisis does not find place in a person taking the scum varuni regularly, always cleaning his body and not suppressing the natural urges. - Ci8#149-164</p>

<p>Wine due to sharpness, non-sliminess and subtle-ness opens the mouth of channels by churning. Consequently, the 7 dhatus revive their process of nourishment (metabolism) and consequently the phthisis succumbs quickly.</p>

<p>In the second age (treta yuga) when Lord Siva was observing the vow of wrathlessness (penance), the demons living on obstacles to penance, created mischief for thousand divine years in order to put obstacles in the penance of the great soul. Daksa Prajapati (Lord of Progeny) though capable ignored even seeing all this. Moreover, he did not give due place to the offerings to Lord Siva in the sacrifice (organized by him) in spite of having been advised by the gods to do so. Thus he made the sacrifice devoid of the mantras relating to the Lord of animals and offerings pertaining to Lord Siva which were necessary for the success of the sacrifice. When after completion of the vow, the god Rudra came to know the lackings of Daksa, he, the knower of the self, came into the wrathful state and by creating a (third) eye in his forehead the potent one, reduced all these demons to ashes and created a boy, heated with the fire of anger, who could destroy the celebrations of the sacrifice. After this the sacrifice was destroyed, the gods were pained and the living beings afflicted with heat and pain were moving here and there in all directions. Then the congregation of gods along with the seven sages praised the omnipresent Lord with incantations till Lord Siva returned to his normal benevolent state. Knowing that he is now in the benevolent mood the fire of wrath, which due to fear holds the weapon of ashes, possesses 3 heads, 9 eyes, is disturbed with burning flames, fierce and gradually has short legs and belly, submitted to the Lord with folded hands– Now, sir! What should I do for you? The Lord replied to him– &#x27;You will be fever in the world during the birth and death and also in conditions of unwholesomeness.&#x27;</p>

<p>The natural [notice the use of this word &quot;natural&quot;] fever arisen in the seasons of spring and autumn is easily curable.</p>
<p>P, being hot itself, gets aggravated further by hot and is thus vitiated in the autumn [which is, according to the calendar of India&#x27;s climate, a time of hot weather resurgence].</p>
<p>Likewise, K accumulated in the cold (season) gets aggravated in the spring.</p>
<p>In the rainy season, P is accumulated due to water and plants having amlavipaka (acidity on digestion) and the same being vitiated due to (intense) heat of the autumn gives rise to fever quickly.</p>
<p>Here K associates as a subsidiary factor.</p>
<p>In such condition, there is no harm by fasting because of the nature of visarga (releasing).</p>
<p>On the other hand, K is accumulated due to sweet water and plants during hemanta (early winter) and gets vitiated in spring due to heat of the sun.</p>
<p>Hence the person suffers from fever due to K in spring in the middle of the adana (recieving) period.</p>
<p>Here V and P are associated as subsidiary factors.</p>

<p>The heavy dosas spread all over the body through the channels carrying rasa and stiffened give rise to santata jwara.</p>
<p>Being unbearable and quick-acting it gets subsided or kills the patient by the period of 7, 10 or 12 days.</p>
<p>Dosa equal in respect of time, dusya (affected tissue) and constitution and having no counter-acting factor causes the remittent fever and as such is quite unbearable.</p>
<p>In remittent fever, as a rule, the doshas also effect urine and feces simultaneously as the dhatus.</p>
<p>This fever gets subsided or becomes fatal in periods of a week etc. [[[7, 10 or12 days]]] according to condition whether the dhatus have been purified completely or not.</p>
<p>When they are not purified completely or entirely the remittent fever gets lodged in the 12 entities (7 dhatus, 3 doshas, urine and feces).</p>
<p>Thus even after remission on 12th day, it continues hidden for a long time without responding to any treatment.</p>
<p>Considering all this, the physician should treat the case of fever.</p>

<p>Anyeduska jwara is caused by dosa which getting support from one of the factors such as time, constitution and dusya obstructs the vessels carrying medas in the presence of the counteracting factor.</p>
<p>In this, fever rises once in 24 hours.</p>
<p>The dosha lodged in asthi (bone) and majja (marrow) causes Tertian and Quartan Fevers.</p>
<p>The paroxysm of dosa is at the interval of 2 days, one day or daily.</p>
<p>The others describe otherwise such as– quotidian fever is caused by the dosa even if it is lodged in rakta. If it goes to the channels of mamsa, it causes tertian fever while it gives rise to quartan fever if it is lodged in the channels of medas.</p>
<p>The quotidian fever comes daily, the tertian on a day&#x27;s interval and the quartan at the interval of 2 days.</p>
<p>Ci11#63-67</p>
<p>Why fever returns/ How doshas hide in the dhatus:</p>
<p>As a seed lies dormant in the soil (for a while) and grows up in (favorable) time, dosas stay in dhatus and get vitiated in opportune time.</p>
<p>The dosa having attained exacerbation and timely strength due to the weakening of the counteracting factor gives rise to the tertian as well as the quartan fever. -#68- 69</p>
<p>After paroxysm, the dosas being weakened stay in their respective places and being reinforced in their opportune times again give rise to fever.</p>

<p>***** Things to avoid in Acute fever:</p>
<p>day-sleep,</p>
<p>bath, *</p>
<p>massage,</p>
<p>solid diet, *</p>
<p>sexual intercourse,</p>
<p>anger,</p>
<p>wind, *</p>
<p>exercise and also extracts (of drugs). *</p>
<p>Lightening therapy:</p>
<p>This is recommended as the first step in treatment of fever.</p>
<p>Ci11#139</p>
<p>Contra-indications of Lightening Therapy in Treatment of Fever:</p>
<p>Yet it should not be used in fever caused by wasting, V, fear, anger, passion, anxiety and exertion.</p>
<p>Ci11#139</p>
<p>Benefits of Lightening Therapy:</p>
<p>morbidity is alleviated and (digestive) fire is kindled, consequently &quot;apyreria&quot; [[apyrexia??], lightness and appetite arise.</p>
<p>Ci11#140</p>
<p>Necessity of Doing Lightening Therapy According to the Strength of the Patient:</p>
<p>Lightening therapy which does not conflict with the strength of the patient should be applied because health depends on strength which the therapeutic management is intended for..</p>
<p>Ci11#141</p>
<p>Treatment of acute fever:</p>
<p>In acute fever lightening, sweating, <strong>time</strong> [just waiting; the dosas will be digested by agni in time, while fasting], gruels and bitters are digestive for immature dosas.</p>
<p>Ci11#142</p>
<p>[Treatment of Acute Fever]:</p>
<p>On appearance of prodromal symptoms or in the beginning of fever, light food or saturation is advised because fever originates from amasaya.</p>
<p>Afterwards, intake of extracts, massage, unction, fomentation, pasting, sprinkling, afterpaste, emesis, purgation, non-unctuous and unctuous enema, pacificatory measures, snuffing, fumigation, smoking, collyrium, milk and dietetic regimen are administered properly according to condition.</p>
<p>Ni1#36</p>
<p>[Treatment of Chronic Fever]:</p>
<p>However, in all types of &#x27;jirna jwara&#x27; (chronic fever), intake of ghee cooked with proper drugs is recommended because ghee pacifies V due to unctuousness, pacifies K due to processing [being processed with drugs], pacifies P and heat due to coldness, hence in all chronic fevers, ghee is wholesome like water is for something being burned by fire.</p>
<p>As they sprinkle water on a burning house to subdue a fire, ghee is administered in chronic fever. - Ni1#37</p>
<p>&#x27;Here are the verses&#x27;:</p>
<p>Ghee pacifies V due to unctuousness, P due to cold and even K which is similar in properties due to processing (with drugs).</p>
<p>No other fat receives the properties of Samskara (processing with drugs) as ghee and that is why it is regarded as the best of fats.</p>
<p>Ni1#38-40</p>
<p>&#x27;The idea expressed in prose is again said afterwards in verses. This is so for (further) clarification and as such the repetition is not despised.</p>
<p>Ni1#41</p>
<p>Treatment of Thirst:</p>
<p>Thirst in V-K fever:</p>
<p>give hot water</p>
<p>Thirst in fever caused by wine or P:</p>
<p>give cold water boiled with bitters</p>
<p>Note: both the above types of water are: appetizer, digestive, anti-pyretic,</p>
<p>channel-cleansing, strengthpromoting, producing relish and sweating and are wholesome. Ci11#143-144</p>
<p>To alleviate thirst and fever:</p>
<p>water</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>musta, parpataka, usira, candana, udicya, sunthi Boil all the above. Allow it to self-cool Ci11#145</p>
<p>Use of Emetics:</p>
<p>In fever which is caused predominantly by aggravated K situated in amasaya **&quot;with tendency to come out&quot; and the patient is fit for vomiting the dosas should be eliminated by administering emetics.</p>
<p>Ci11#146</p>
<p>Risk of Applying Purgatives in Acute Fever:</p>
<p>If emetic is administered in acute fever when the dosas are not tending to come out it is liable to produce heart disease, dyspnea, hardness in bowels and mental disturbance.</p>
<p>To make and attempt to eliminate the dosas which are spread all over the body, associated with ama, seated in dhatu and extractable with difficulty is risky like making an attempt to extract juice from unripe fruits.</p>
<p>Ci11#147-148</p>
<p>Use of Gruels:</p>
<p>After emesis and lightening the patient should be provided with gruels in time cooked with respective drugs starting with scum-gruel in the beginning till the fever comes down or for 6 days.</p>
<p>By this agni is stimulated like fire by fuel.</p>
<p>Due to medication and lightness, they are appetizer, carminative for wind, urine, feces and dosas; due to being hot and liquid they are diaphoretic; due to being liquid they alleviate thirst, due to being nutrient they provide strength; due to being laxative they produce lightness and due to being suitable in fevers they act as antipyretic.</p>
<p>Hence the wise physicians, from the very beginning, manage the cases of fever with gruels.</p>
<p>Ci11#148-152</p>
<p>Contra-Indications of Use of Gruels in Fever:</p>
<p>It is not advised in fever associated with alcoholism, alcoholic addicts, in summer, having predominance of P and K or with upward internal hemorrhage (hemoptisys, epistaxis, etc.).</p>
<p>Ci11#153-154</p>
<p>Treatment in the Fever Cases Contra-Indicated for Gruel:</p>
<p>In such cases, saturating drinks of parched paddy flour or antipyretic fruit juice should be given along with honey and sugar.</p>
<p>Ci11#155</p>
<p>Diet to be Give in Fever [concurrently with the gruels/ {after the stage of the gruels}/ only in the case of the cases which listed above in &quot;contraindications of use of gruels&quot;]:</p>
<p>Considering suitability and strength, these diets should be given along with green gram soup or soup of the meat of wild animals after the saturating drink is digested.</p>
<p>At the time of meal, the patient should be advised to brush his teeth with a twig which has taste contrary to that of his mouth and is according to his liking.</p>
<p>This produces non-sliminess in mouth, desire for food and drinks and sharpened perception of the taste sensation.</p>
<p>After cleaning his teeth with the plant-twig and washing his mouth many times, he should take meal along with curd-water, sugarcane juice, wine etc. as directed.</p>
<p>Ci11#156-159</p>
<p>In case of fever, after 6 days have passed, the physician after giving light diet should administer digestive or pacifying extract of herbs.</p>
<p>Ci11#160</p>
<p>Contra-Indication of [Astringent] Extracts During Acute Stage of Fever:</p>
<p>If extracts are administered in acute fever they bind up the dosas due to astringency which are held up without being digested and thus cause visamajwara (intermittent fever).</p>
<p>In fact, extract as preparation is not contra-indicated in acute fever but the extract of astringent drugs.</p>
<p>Ci11#160-162</p>
<p>Diet for [first 10 days/ 10 days following period of the use gruels/...]:</p>
<p>One should eat light food along with beneficial vegetable soups, soured or unsoured, or soup of the meat of wild animals till 10 days for alleviation of fever.</p>
<p>Ci11#163</p>
<p>Use of Ghee in [mature fever with] mild K:</p>
<p>Thereafter [after 10 days/ after stage of above diet/ after dosas have been welldigested] in case of fever having mild K and severe V and P and with dosas well digested, intake of ghee acts like nectar.</p>
<p>Ci11#164</p>
<p>Treatment of persistent K in fever:</p>
<p>In case even after 10 days there is predominance of K and the patient is not lightened completely, the physician should not use ghee but should treat him with extracts till lightness is attained along with the diet with meat-soup because strength is necessary to overcome the disorders and meat soup provides strength.</p>
<p>Ci11#165-166</p>

<p>In case of the fever causing burning sensation and thirst, having predominance of V and P, dosas constipated or discharged profusely and freedom from ama, intake of milk should be advised.</p>
<p>Ci11#167</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="treatment-with-purgation-in">Treatment with Purgation in...:<a href="#treatment-with-purgation-in" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Treatment with Purgation in...:" title="Direct link to Treatment with Purgation in...:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>If the fever does not subside even by these measures, one should pacify it by purgation if the patient has unimpaired strength, musculature and agni.</p>
<p>Ci11#168</p>
<p>Removal of excrements and dosas in patients reduced [(slightly emaciated)]by fever:</p>
<p>In patients reduced by fever neither emesis nor purgation is beneficial.</p>
<p>In such cases, the excrements should be eliminated by adequate intake of milk or administration of non-unctuous enema.</p>
<p>Non-unctuous enema, if applied on full maturity of dosas, provides strength, digestive power, freedom from fever, happiness and relish quickly.</p>
<p>Ci11#169-170</p>
<p>Role of Purgation and Enema:</p>
<p>Purgation- eliminates P or K-P situated in the pittasaya Enema- eliminates all 3 doshas situated in the pakvasaya</p>
<p>Ci11#171</p>
<p>In chronic fever when K and P are reduced, appetite is firm and stool is rough and constipated, unctuous enema should be applied.</p>
<p>Ci11#172</p>
<p>In chronic fever if there are heaviness and pain in head and senses are blocked headevacuation should be applied which also provides relish.</p>
<p>Ci11#173</p>
<p>Use of Massage, Anointing, Sprinkling and Baths:</p>
<p>The physician should advise massage, anointing, sprinkling and bath, cold or hot, as necessary.</p>
<p>By these, the fever situated in external passages is pacified, organs get pleasure and strength and complexion are promoted.</p>
<p>Ci11#174-175</p>
<p>Use of incense and collyrium:</p>
<p>the cases of chronic fever having remnant only in skin and where there is association of some extrinsic factor get relief from &#x27;applications&#x27; of incense and collyrium. [locally]</p>
<p>Ci11#176</p>
<p>Drugs Used For Treating Fever:</p>
<p>The old [aged] cereals of red sali, sastika etc. are recommended for use in the forms of</p>
<p>gruel, boiled rice and parched paddy which alleviate fever.</p>

<p>Some physicians do not reccomend the meat of cock, peacock, partridge, heron and vartaka (a quail) in fever due to their property of heaviness and hotness.</p>
<p>But in Atreya&#x27;s view if there is severity of V due to lightening the wise physician should administer them as well considering time, dose and preparation.</p>
<p>Ci11#190-193</p>
<p>Use of Hot Water or Wine as After-drink in Thirst:</p>
<p>If there is thirst, hot water should be given for after-drink or wine to those who are addicted to it considering the dosa and strength of the patient.</p>

<p>Ci11#267</p>
<p>Treatment of Cold Fever with Fomentation and Other Means:</p>
<p>The 13 types of fomentation described in the concerned chapter (su 14) should be applied by the physician according to dose and time to alleviate the cold fever.</p>
<p>The same hut, the cot and the coverings along with dense incense of aguru pacify the cold fever.</p>
<p>Young women with well-constituted body pacify the cold fever by their embracing due to the heat of the youthful age.</p>
<p>Ci11#268-270</p>
<p>Diet for Treatment of Cold Fever:</p>
<p>Diaphoretic food and drinks and those which alleviate V and K overcome cold fever if applied considering the comparative strength of the above 2 doshas in combination [in the particular case of fever concerned].</p>
<p>Ci11#271</p>
<p>[Here follows a few paragraphs information on lightening and light and heavyness]</p>
<p>Contra-indications for Lightening Therapy in Fever Treatment:</p>
<p>Lightening is not indicated in the fever caused by V, exertion, injury and the chronic one.</p>
<p>Ci11#272</p>
<p>Proper Treatment for {the above-mentioned cases}[the light/depletion] fever:</p>
<p>These cases should be managed with pacificatory measures.</p>
<p>Ci11#273</p>
<p>Movement of Dosas and Agni in Amasaya and Dhatus:</p>
<p>As the dosas, having thrown out the gastric fire and circulating along the rasa produce fever, the power of digestion diminishes.</p>
<p>Even the increased fire under the stove with plenty of fuel will not cook food in the cooking pot if the fire is blown aside by a wind. In this same way, when the digestive fire gets thrown out of its normal location by dosas in the patient of fever, it can not digest the food taken or it can only digest light food with difficulty.</p>
<p>It is because of this that management with lightening etc. has been prescribed.</p>
<p>Ci11#274-276</p>
<p>*** Natural Processing of Dosas [by the Dhatu&#x27;s Agnis] in 7 Days:</p>
<p>*** Dosas entered into the 7 dhatus get digested in the period of a week.</p>
<p>That is why the fever is said as mature on the 8th day. - Ci11#277 Consequence of Heavy Food Intake in Fever:</p>
<p>The patient having diminished agni and aggravated dosas is left suddenly by the vital breath or suffers for long if he takes food particularly some heavy one.</p>
<p>Because of this reason the wise physician should not prescribe diet in large quantity or excessively heavy or fatty from the start or the fever even in V fever.</p>
<p>Ci11#277-278</p>
<p>Treatment Program in Pure, Nirama V Fever:</p>
<p>In V fever, if there is no association of any other dosa, massage etc. should be applied ignoring the usual procedure.</p>
<p>Thereafter he should be given medicinal extract and then diet with meat soup.</p>
<p>Other measures efficacious in chronic fever should also be adopted.</p>
<p>Ci11#279-280</p>
<p>Progress and Treatment of a K fever in a K Patient:</p>
<p>In patients who are constitutionally predominant in K and deficient in V if fever comes with abundant K and low fever it does not mature even in a week due to mild agni.</p>
<p>Hence he should be managed with the said lightening, light diet, etc. till 10 days and thereafter with medicinal extracts.</p>
<p>Ci11#281-282</p>
<p>Treatment of Ama, K or K-P associated with Fever:</p>
<p>Fevers which are associated with ama, or are caused by K or K-P should be subject to lightening measures as described in the concerned chapter (su 22).</p>
<p>Ci11#283</p>
<p>Emesis, Purgation and Enema For Fever:</p>
<p>Fever caused by K should be treated with - emesis P Purgation V Enema</p>
<p>Ci11#284</p>
<p>Treatment of Dual or Aggravated Doshas in Fever:</p>
<p>In case of fever caused by dual or aggravated dosas one should prescribe proper drugs considering their comparative predominance or equality.</p>
<p>Ci11#285</p>
<p>Treatment of Sannipataja Fever:</p>
<p>This should be treated by increasing the diminished dosas, decreasing the</p>
<p>aggravated ones and keeping the condition of the location of K (amasaya) in view.</p>
<p>Ci11#286</p>
<p>Incidence and Treatment of Swelling At the Root of the Ears:</p>
<p>In the end of the aggregated [sannipata] fever, severe swelling occurs at the root of the ears [ this could be, but doesn&#x27;t sound like, anaphylactic shock swelling] from which one rarely survives.</p>
<p>It should be treated with prompt blood-letting, intake of ghee, anointings, snuffings, and gargles which alleviate K and P. - Ci11#287-288 Treatment of Obstinate Cases with Blood-Letting:</p>
<p>Fever which does not subside by treatment with cold, hot, unctuous, non-unctuous etc. and has entered into &quot;sakha&quot; (rakta etc.) is treated with blood-letting.</p>
<p>Ci11#289</p>
<p>Treatment of various other types of fever:</p>
<p>Fever arisen due to erysipelas, injury and eruptions, is treated first with the intake of ghee if it is not predominant in K and P.</p>
<p>Ci11#290</p>
<p>Chronic fever continues because of the debility of bodily dhatus, hence it should be managed with the diet promoting strength and body-bulk.</p>
<p>Ci11#291</p>
<p>The usual procedure should be left in tertian and quartan fever because there is often extrinsic factor associated with the intermittent fever.</p>
<p>Visamajwara which is predominant in V should be treated with ghee, enema (nonunctuous and unctuous) and fatty and hot food and drinks.</p>
<p>Visamajwara ([intermittent fever]) predominant in P should be treated with purgation, milk, medicated ghee, bitter and cold drugs.</p>
<p>Visamajwara predominant in K should be treated with emesis, digestives, rough diet, lightening measures, astringent and hot drugs.</p>
<p>Ci11#292-295</p>
<p>&quot;Now I shall mention the formulations which alleviate intermittent fever.&quot; [But it seems that basic treatment for intermittent fever has just been given, above. And the following information intermittent fever is pretty general; not specific formulas].</p>
<p>Concentrated wine for drink, cock, partridge and peacock in diet should be used in intermittent fever.</p>
<p>The patient should take satpala ghrta or haritaki, or decoction of triphala or juice of guduci, or decoction of nilini, ajagandha, trivrta and katurohini, at the advent of the fever, after unction and fomentation, or he should take the large dose of ghee and then vomit it, or after taking plenty of meal he should vomit, or after a good meal he should take plenty of wine and then go to bed.</p>
<p>In intermittent fever, one should prescribe non-unctuous or sustaining enemas or the patient should take cat&#x27;s feces along with milk on the same day, or the bull&#x27;s feces added with rock salt along with curd-scum or wine.</p>
<p>The use of pippali, triphala, curd, buttermilk, pancagavya ghrta and milk is</p>
<p>commended in intermittent fever.</p>
<p>The fever is prevented by wearing gems, auspicious herbs and poison and also by</p>
<p>he should be &quot;detracted&quot; with favorite and surprising objects.</p>
<p>Ci11#323</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="signs-of-remission-of-fever">Signs of Remission of Fever:<a href="#signs-of-remission-of-fever" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Signs of Remission of Fever:" title="Direct link to Signs of Remission of Fever:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>During remission of fever, the patient groans, vomits, moves, respires, becomes pale, has perspired organ, trembles, faints frequently, has delirium, whole body being hot or cold, becomes unconscious and as if filled with anger during rise of fever, passes feces with impurity and sound, liquid and with force.</p>
<p>Ci11#324-326</p>
<p>&quot;In case the patient has profuse morbidity and the fever is acute and high, the remission occurs by crisis due to proper management and maturation of dosas.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the fever is chronic, the fever having risen due to (aggravation of)dosa gradually comes down. This is remission by lysis.&quot;</p>
<p>Ci11#326-328</p>
<p>The patient should be taken as free from fever when exhaustion and pyrexia are gone, there is no distress, senses are clear and the psyche has revived normalcy.</p>
<p>Ci11#329</p>
<p>Items to Abstain from:</p>
<p>The patient during fever or convalescence should avoid burning, heavy, unsuitable and antagonistic food and drinks.</p>
<p>He should also abstain from sequal intercourse, over-work, bath and over-eating. Thus fever subsides and thereafter does not relapse.</p>
<p>During convalescence one should not take exercise, sexual intercourse, bath and walking till he regains strength.</p>
<p>Ci11#330-332</p>
<p>Consequence of taking these Avoidables during convalescence:</p>
<p>If one takes these avoidable food and activities during convalescence before regaining normal strength, the fever relapses.</p>
<p>It also relapses even with slight mis-management in cases where temperature comes down though the dosas are not eliminated properly.</p>
<p>That relapsed fever kills the patient suffering since long, debilitated and with poor agni in a short time.</p>
<p>Some times dosas get matured in successive dhatus, thus they do not produce fever but cause harm to the body.</p>
<p>They produce anxious expression, swelling, malaise, paleness, anorexia, itching, rashes, pimples and mildness of appetite.</p>
<p>Similarly, other treated disorders too relapse on a slight unwholesome activity if dosas are not eliminated properly.</p>
<p>Hence, even after the fever subsides, dosas should be eliminated or pacified according to condition, strength and vitality (of the patient).</p>
<p>In such cases, evacuation with mild measures, sustaining enemas, light vegetable soup and meat-soups of the wild animals are wholesome.</p>
<p>Massage, anointing, bath, incense, collyrium, bitter ghee are prescribed in relapsed fever.</p>
<p>If the fever relapses due to heavy, channel-blocking and unsuitable diet, management with lightening and hot therapy as mentioned above may be done.</p>
<p>Ci11#333-342</p>
<p>The following decoction, taken regularly, destroys relapsing fever:</p>
<p>kiratatikta, kutaki, musta, parpataka, guduci</p>
<ul>
<li class="">water Make a decoction with all the above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ci11#343</p>
<p>The wise physician, considering the management of fever, should treat the case according to the condition.</p>
<p>Ci11#344</p>
<p>Fever is the king of all diseases, destroyer of all creatures and severe, hence a physician should be particularly cautious in treating it.</p>
<p>Ci11#345</p>

<p>With blood exceeding it&#x27;s normal measure the vitiated P, while circulating in the body, reaches the openings of blood-carrying channels originating from the liver and spleen, obstructs them which are already heavy due to congestion of blood and thus affects the blood morbidly.</p>

<p>P is called &#x27;lohitapitta&#x27; because it contacts with blood, affects it and acquires it&#x27;s smell and color. [[loha means iron; perhaps like rust-colored; red. Perhaps loha has other meanings]]</p>

<p>In order to pacify this quick-acting and emergent condition which is like a forest fire: prompt action should be taken carefully to treat it with saturating or desaturating soft, sweet, cold bitter and astringent diet and paste, sprinklings, bath, touching, emesis etc. taking due consideration of dose, place and time.</p>
<p>Ni2#11</p>
<p>&#x27;Here are the verses&#x27;:</p>
<p>Raktapitta which comes upwards is curable because of applicability of purgation and abundance of useful drugs. - Ni2#12</p>
<p>Purgation is the best remedy for alleviation of P and also not ineffective for K which is associated with it. - Ni2#13</p>
<p>Sweet drugs are also applicable there. - Ni2#13</p>
<p>Hence hemorrhage coming out from the upper part is curable.</p>
<p>Ni2#14</p>
<p>Hemorrhage from the lower parts is decidedly palliable because emesis is slightly applicable here and useful drugs are also a few.</p>
<p>Emesis is not so efficacious for elimination of P and it is also ineffective in alleviation of V which is associated with P.</p>
<p>Moreover, astringent and bitter drugs are not applicable there.</p>
<p>Hence hemorrhage from the lower parts is regarded as palliable.</p>
<p>Ni2#15-17</p>
<p>Raktapitta which comes out from both the parts should be known as incurable from the aforesaid reasons.</p>
<p>Here no evacuative measure is applicable which goes out from the path opposite to that of hemorrhage.</p>
<p>In raktapitta, elimination of dosa from the opposite path is recommended.</p>
<p>&#x27;Likewise, there is no alround pacificatory measure for this while in combined dosas the pacificatory measure should be able to pacify all the dosas.&#x27;</p>
<p>Thus 3 types of raktapitta have been described according to the different paths.</p>
<p>Ni2#18-20</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="importance-to-not-check-raktpitta-in-certain-cases">Importance to not check raktpitta in certain cases:<a href="#importance-to-not-check-raktpitta-in-certain-cases" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Importance to not check raktpitta in certain cases:" title="Direct link to Importance to not check raktpitta in certain cases:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Internal hemorrhage having much impurity and excited and in a person who is not emaciated and weak and takes normal food should not be checked in the very beginning.</p>
<p>If checked at the very start, it produces choking of the throat, fetid smell from the nose, fainting, anorexia, fever, gulma, spleen enlargement, hardness of bowels, leucoderma, dysuria, leprosy, piles, erysipelas, loss of complexion, fistula-in-ano, obstruction to intellect and senses.</p>
<p>Hence one desiring success should ignore, at first, the internal hemorrhage started in a strong patient considering the strength and condition of the morbidity.</p>
<p>[this last sentence is redundant; remove.]</p>
<p>Ci4#25-28</p>
<p>Ama Involvement and Lightening Therapy:</p>
<p>&quot;Mostly the raktapitta excited by amadosa of the person aggravates, hence he should be managed with lightening measures.&quot;</p>
<p>[translation: In most cases of raktapitta, it is ama which aggravates it. So, the raktapitta should be managed indirectly by managing ama with lightening therapy.] Ci4#29</p>
<p>Lightening or Saturating Therapy:</p>
<p>The physician should apply in the beginning of raktapitta, lightening or saturating measures according to passage, association of dosa and etiology.</p>
<p>[So, as far as treatment in terms of passage:</p>
<p>Upward-moving raktapitta, being K should be treated with lightening. Downward-moving raktapitta, being V, should be treated with uncting/ &quot;saturating&quot; (if it is relatively nirama).] Ci4#30</p>
<p>Drinks to Use:</p>
<p>The patient who feels thirsty should be given this drink:</p>
<p>hribera, candana, usira, musta and prapataka</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>water</p>
<p>Boil the above together. - Ci4#31</p>
<p>Or the patient may be given cooled boiled water.</p>
<p>Ci4#31</p>
<p>One having knowledge of constitution and preparation should prescribe saturating drink in upward raktapitta and liquid gruel in downward raktapitta [note: this contradicts my statement above] considering time, suitability and association of dosas.</p>
<p>Ci4#32</p>
<p>The following is a saturating drink to use:</p>
<p>kharjura</p>
<p>Mrdwika (fruits)</p>
<p>Madhuka (dry flowers)</p>
<p>Parusaka (fruit)</p>
<p>Water</p>
<p>Boil the above together.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">sugar Mix all together. Serve cooled. Ci4#33</li>
</ul>
<p>The following saturating &quot;preparation&quot; [not a drink], if taken timely, alleviates the upward-moving raktapitta:</p>
<p>Powder of parched paddy + honey, ghee [but no water/ liquid...] Ci4#34</p>
<p>These additions may be made to the saturating preparation if the patient has poor digestion and is suited to sour things:</p>
<p>pomegranates amalaka fruits Ci4#35</p>
<p>Diet in Raktapitta:</p>
<p>The patient of raktapitta should take meal consisting of the cereals of sali, sastika, nivara, koradusa, prasantika, syamaka and priyangu.</p>
<p>For them, gram, lentils, green grams, makustha and adhaki are commended for the pulse-soup.</p>
<p>The vegetables useful in raktapitta are patola, nimba, tip of vetra, tender leaves of plaksa and vetasa, kiratitkta, gandira and kathillaka.</p>
<p>The flowers of kovidara, kasmarya and salmali are also used as vegetable in diet and also similar substances which alleviate raktapitta.</p>
<p>These vegetables should be prepared by boiling or frying with ghee or like soup and given to the vegetarian patients as vegetable.</p>
<p>Dove, pigeon, common quail, raktaksa (crane), vartaka (a quail), grey partridge, ena, harina and kalapucchaka (types of deer) are wholesome in raktapitta. Their soups are used soured or unsoured, fried with ghee and added with sugar.</p>
<p>In raktapitta associated with K: vegetable soup is good.</p>
<p>In raktapitta associated with V: meat soup is prescribed.</p>
<p>Ci4#36-39</p>
<p>Here Follows a Section On Gruels for Raktapitta:</p>
<p>This gruel may be used:</p>

<p>Ci4#52</p>
<p>Items to Avoid:</p>
<p>Whatever etiological factors of raktapitta have been mentioned should not be used by the patients of raktapitta if they wish to survive and to be free from the disease.</p>
<p>Ci4#53</p>
<p>The Management of Strong Patients having Plenty of Dosas:</p>
<p>Raktapitta arisen due to over-saturation in a strong patient who has no emaciation and debility but the disorder is enormous should be treated with evacuative therapy by purgation (in upward type) and emesis (in downward type). This should be done in a proper time schedule, and only if the patient is fit for such therapy and if the disease has no complication.</p>
<p>Ci4#54-55</p>
<p>[Upward raktapitta may be treated by downward purgation.</p>
<p>[Downward raktapitta may be treated by upward emesis.]</p>
<p>The following is a purgative formula to be used [[in upward r.]]:</p>
<p>Decoction of- trivrta, haritaki, fruit of aragvadha, trayamana, indrayana (roots) or amalaka (fruits)</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>

<p>There are many fatal diseases but they do not take away the life so quickly as hiccup and dyspnea. -Ci27#6</p>
<p>Moreover, in the person suffering from the other various disorders, severe hiccup or dyspnea arises at the end.</p>
<p>Ci27#7</p>
<p>Hikka and swasa are predominant in K and V. [both]</p>
<p>They arise from the seat of P [the small intestine?] and dry up the heart and the dhatus.</p>
<p>Hence, both hiccup and dyspnea being similar are regarded as very difficult to overcome and if managed badly they get aggravated further and kill the patients like serpents.</p>
<p>Ci27#8-9</p>
<p>In the chapter on enumeration of diseases (Su. 19) each of them has been said as of 5 types.</p>
<p>Etiology for Hiccup and Dyspnea:</p>
<p>These 2 diseases arise due to dust, smoke, wind, residing in cold place and using cold water, physical exertion, sexual intercourse, traveling on foot, intake of rough food, irregular meals, vitiation of ama, distention of bowels, roughness, oversaturation, debility, injury to vital parts, use of duals (cold and hot etc.) together and excessive evacuation.</p>
<p>They may arise as complications in diseases such as diarrhea, fever, vomiting, coryza, chest injury with wasting, internal hemorrhage, upward movement of V, visucika, alasaka, panduroga and poisoning.</p>
<p>They also arise due to intake of nispava, black gram, oil cake, sesamum and oil, flour preparations, tubers, distending, burning and heavy food, aquatic and marshy meat, curd, unboiled milk, channel-blocking regimens and use of K-aggravating things leading to obstruction in throat and chest and various other sorts of retention.</p>
<p>Ci27#10-16</p>
<p>Pathology:</p>
<p>V situated in chest entering into the channels carrying vital breath is vitiated and enforcing the K further gives rise to hiccup and dyspnea (each of 5 types) which are of severe nature and impede the vital breath in living creatures.</p>
<p>Ci27#17</p>
<p>Prodromal Symptoms of Hiccup:</p>
<p>Heaviness in throat and chest, astringency in mouth and gurgling sound in abdomen.</p>
<p>Ci27#19</p>
<p>Prodromal Symptoms of Dyspnea:</p>
<p>Hardness in bowels, pain in sides, compression in cardiac region, mis-passage of vital breath [what does that mean; breath coming into esophagus instead of larynx?]</p>
<p>Ci27#20</p>
<p>Etiology of Hiccup:</p>
<p>V along with K obstructs the channels of vital breath, water and food and thus produce hiccup.</p>
<p>Ci27#21</p>

<p>In strong patients all the types swasas are curable if they are not manifest fully. Ci27#66</p>
<p>Treatment of Hikka and Swasa:</p>
<p>Of them these fatal ones should be rejected because they are very severe and galloping. - Ci27#68</p>
<p>The other types which are curable and maintainable should be managed by the physician quickly with proper medicaments because if neglected they may reduce the body to ashes like the fire burning the dried tree.</p>
<p>Ci27#69</p>
<p>Identical Management for Hikka and Swasa:</p>
<p>Both hikka and swasa are managed identically due to their identical etiology, location and root.</p>
<p>Ci27#70</p>
<p>General Management:</p>
<p>There are 4 stages: [see notes @ strong vs. weak trtmnt; weak won&#x27;t get</p>
<p>emesis/ purgation]</p>
<p>I: massage and Unctuous Fomentation</p>
<p>II: Pre-emesis diet for vitiating K in stomach</p>
<p>III: Emesis</p>
<p>IV: Smoking to remove remaining ama</p>
<p>Ci27#71-72</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="step-i-unctuous-fomentation">Step I; Unctuous Fomentation:<a href="#step-i-unctuous-fomentation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step I; Unctuous Fomentation:" title="Direct link to Step I; Unctuous Fomentation:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The patient of hiccup and dyspnea should, at first, be managed with unctuous sudation by tubular, bed and bolus methods after he is massaged with salted oil. Ci27#73</p>
<p>[Note: no oil is given internally.] [Note: oil, not ghee or other heavy</p>
<p>sbstnce] ** By this his &quot;inspissated&quot; phlegm into the channels gets dissolved and thereby the passages become soft and V returns to it&#x27;s normal course.</p>
<p>[So here is shown that external oil massage and fomentation -without internal oleation- is sufficient to get ama and doshas to move out of the tissues and back to the main channels.]</p>
<p>** As on hilly forests the snow is liquefied by the heat of sun-rays, the sticky phlegm in the body gets dissolved by the heat of sudation. [This is so simple a concept/ explanation]</p>
<p>Ci27#74</p>
<p>Step II; Pre-emesis Diet:</p>
<p>After full sudation the patient should be given the diet consisting of rice with uncting substance along with meat soup of fish or boar or with the supernatant fatty layer of curd. [moderately heavy, K increasing substances.]</p>
<p>Ci27#75</p>
<p>Step III; Emesis:</p>
<p>In this way, when K is increased, he should be advised to take emesis [emetic formula] mixed with pippali, rock salt and honey [a nice K and V reducing emetic mix] and &quot;which is not very antagonistic to V&quot;.</p>
<p>On elimination of deranged phlegm he gets relief and V also starts moving unimpeded after the channels are cleansed.</p>
<p>Ci27#76</p>
<p>Step IV; Smoking to Remove Remaining [Morbidity/K/Phlegm]:</p>
<p>If some pathogenic material still remains hidden, it should be eliminated by smoking. - Ci27#77</p>
<p>Here follows a few smoking formulas which may be used:</p>
<p>This formula should be smoked:</p>
<p>haridra, patra, eranda (root), lac, realgar, devadaru, orpiment, mamsi Powder all the above together.</p>
<p>Make into sticks.</p>
<p>To use, smear a stick with ghee and smoke [on a pipe?; see &quot;Dhuman Chart&quot;]. Ci27#77</p>
<p>The following formula may be used:</p>
<p>Barley grains</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>ghee</p>
<p>Mix the above together. [other processing?].</p>
<p>Smoke.</p>
<p>Ci27#78</p>
<p>The following may be used:</p>
<p>&quot;Bee-wax*, sarjarasa and ghee are put together in the closed space between the 2 earthen plates. In this [the closed space between 2 earthen plates/ {with the above formula}] horns, hairs and ligaments of cow (or bull) may be smoked.&quot;[this may be 1 big formula or 2 smaller formulas.]</p>
<p>Ci27#79</p>
<p>The following formula may be used:</p>
<p>&quot;The dried tubular leaf-stalks of syonaka and eranda or kusa or padmaka, guggulu, aguru and sallaki *mixed with ample ghee* should be smoked.&quot; [the tubular stalks may be used as the body of a pipe, like a cigarette. Ghee (and other ingredients) may be smeared on them. I&#x27;m also not sure how many of the items above are tubes, and how many are to be powdered to be pasted on the other tubes...]</p>
<p>Ci27#80</p>
<p>Hiccup and dyspnea associated with feeble voice, diarrhea, internal hemorrhage and burning sensation should be managed with sweet, unctuous and cold regimen etc.</p>
<p>Ci27#81</p>
<p>Contraindications of Sudation in Hikka-Swasa:</p>
<p>Sudation should not be applied to those suffering from P, burning sensation, profuse hemorrhaging or sweating, loss of dhatus and strength and those who are roughened, pregnant or of P constitution.</p>
<p>Ci27#82</p>
<p>Detail on Fomentation:</p>
<p>The region of chest and throat should be fomented as desired with warm sprinkling of uncting substance mixed with sugar or with soft poultices of utkarika (a dietary preparation) for a very short period. - Ci27#83</p>
<p>For this, the following formula may be used:</p>
<p>Utkarika prepared of:</p>
<p>Sesamum, linseed Black gram</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>V-alleviating substances Uncting substances Sour things or Milk</p>
<p>Ci27#84</p>
<p>In case of acute fever and ama dosa:</p>
<p>Rough sudation and lightening or emesis with salt water should be advised according to condition.</p>
<p>Ci27#85</p>
<p>If V is aggravated due to excessive application of these regimens:</p>
<p>It should be brought to normalcy by administering V-alleviating regimens, meat soup etc, with moderate heat and massages.</p>
<p>Ci27#86</p>
<p>In condition of reverse movement of V and tympanitis:</p>
<p>Food mixed with matulunga and amlavetasa or hingu, pilu and bida (salt) should be taken. This acts as a carminative.</p>
<p>Ci27#87</p>
<ul>
<li class="">** There Are Two Categories of Hikka and Swasa:</li>
<li class="">* Among patients of hiccup and dyspnea, one group consists of strong ones and the other of weak ones.</li>
<li class="">* The strong group:</li>
</ul>
<p>is dominant in K while</p>
<p>The weak group:</p>
<p>is rough and is dominant in V.</p>
<p>[Duplicate this valuable info to beginning of this chptr., with diagnosis sctn.]</p>
<p>** Treatment of Hikka and Swasa in the Strong group, predominant in K: Emesis and purgation should be administered keeping the patient on wholesome diet followed by pacificatory management with smoking and linctus etc. Ci27#89</p>
<p>** Treatment of Hikka and Swasa in the Weak group, predominant in V:</p>
<p>In patients having predominance of V and debility and in children and old persons, saturating management should be applied with V-alleviating and pacificatory uncting substances vegetable and meat soups etc.</p>
<p>Ci27#90</p>
<p>* Importance of Not Evacuating Depleted Patient:</p>
<p>By administering evacuative treatment to the patients in whom K is not excited and who are unformed and weak, V finds place and by drying up the vital organ takes away life instantaneously. - Ci27#91</p>
<p>Hence those having strength and dominance of K should, at first, be saturated with meat soup of marshy or aquatic animals, fomented and thereafter evacuated. - Ci27#92</p>
<p>The patients of the opposite group [(weak, V)] should be subjected to promotive measures [skipping the evacuation entirely]]. - Ci27#92</p>
<p>* For them, meat of peacock, partridge, cock and wild animals and birds cooked in decoction of dasamula or horse gram is wholesome.</p>

<p>* General Strategy:</p>
<p>Whatever drug or diet alleviates K and V, is hot and carminative is wholesome for one suffering from dyspnea and hiccup. - Ci27#147</p>
<ul>
<li class="">* Strategy about Lightening or Pacifying:</li>
<li class="">* Single-sided treatment such as K-alleviating but V-aggravating or V-alleviating but K-aggravating should not be done in these cases.</li>
<li class="">* However, between these 2 the V-alleviating measures are preferable.</li>
<li class="">* In all cases, there is little and manageable risk in administering promoting regimen, and in pacifying measures.</li>
<li class="">* But the risk is too much [a lot] and unmanageable in lightening (or reducing) measures .</li>
<li class="">* Hence the patients of hiccup and dyspnea evacuated or unevacuated, should be managed mostly with promotive and pacifying measures.</li>

<p>Treatment of the 20 Types</p>
<p>20 types of female genital disorders are mentioned in the chapter on enumeration of diseases (Su 19).</p>
<p>General Eteology:</p>
<p>These disorders arise in women due to:</p>
<p>Faulty practices, deranged menstrual flow, defect in ovum and fate. Ci30#8</p>
<p>Etiology of V Yonivyapat:</p>
<p>Occurs in the woman of V constitution following V-aggravating diet and practices.</p>
<p>Ci30#9</p>
<p>Pathology and Symptoms of V Vyapat:</p>
<p>V gets aggravated and having been located in the genital tract produces piercing and other types of pain, stiffness, feeling of crawling of ants, hardness and numbness of vagina, exhaustion and other V disorders.</p>
<p>Due to V her menstrual discharge appears with sound, painful, frothy, thin and rough.</p>
<p>Ci30#10</p>
<p>Etiology of P Yonivyapat:</p>
<p>Is due to excessive use of pungent, sour, salty, alkaline things etc.</p>
<p>Ci30#11</p>
<p>Pathology and Symptoms of P Yonivyapat:</p>
<p>Because of affection with P, the genital tract suffers from burning sensation, inflammation, fever and heat.</p>
<p>The menstrual flow is blue, yellow or black and with excessive, hot discharge having cadaverous smell.</p>
<p>Ci30#12</p>
<p>Etiology of K Yonivyapat:</p>
<p>K gets aggravated by channel-blocking things and thus effects the genital tract. Ci30#13</p>
<p>Pathology and Symptoms of K Yonivyapat:</p>
<p>Aggravated K makes the track as slimy, cold, itching, with mild pain and pale. The menstrual flow is pale and slimy.</p>
<p>Ci30#14</p>
<p>Tridoshic Yonivyapat:</p>
<p>When a woman uses excessively all the rasas, all 3 dosas located in the genital tract and uterus produce their symptoms there.</p>

<p>Nature and Cause defective Semen:</p>
<p>As seed (of a plant) does not sprout of affected by improper time, water, worms, insects and fire so is the defective semen of man.</p>
<p>Ci30#134</p>
<p>Causes of Defects in Semen:</p>
<p>Due to excessive coitus, exercise, use of unsuitable things, untimely coitus, coitus in non-vagina and absence therefrom [absence of vagina/absence of coitus/..], excessive intake of rough, bitter, astringent, salty, sour and hot things, ignorance about the taste of woman, abnormal discharge, old age, anxiety, grief, suspicion, faulty application, fear, anger, exorcism, emaciation caused by diseases, suppression of urge, wound and morbid affection of dhatus, doshas singly or collectively, having reached the semen-carrying vessels cause defects in semen.</p>
<p>Ci30#135-138</p>
<p>The 8 Types of Defects of Semen:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">frothy, 2) thin, 3) rough, 4) of abnormal color, 5) fetid, 6) slimy, 7) combined with other dhatus, 8) precipitant</li>
</ol>
<p>Ci30#139</p>
<p>Symptoms of Semen affected by V:</p>
<p>It becomes frothy, thin, rough and is ejaculated with difficulty and in little quantity.</p>
<p>It has no potency for fertilization.</p>
<p>Ci30#140</p>
<p>Symptoms of Semen affected by P:</p>
<p>Is bluish or yellow, very hot, fetid and is ejaculated with burning sensation.</p>
<p>Ci30#140</p>
<p>Symptom of Semen affected by K:</p>
<p>If semen is obstructed in its passage by K, it becomes exceedingly slimy.</p>
<p>Ci30#141</p>
<p>Symptoms of Semen affected by excessive coitus, injury and wound:</p>
<p>Due to these things, semen comes out often with blood.</p>
<p>Ci30#142</p>
<p>Due to suppression of urges, semen obstructed in it&#x27;s passage by V comes out with difficulty and as knotted and precipitant.</p>
<p>Ci30#143</p>
<p>Thus, the above are the 8 defects of semen and their characters.</p>
<p>Ci30#144</p>
<p>Character of Normal Semen:</p>
<p>Semen which is unctuous, viscous, slimy, sweet, non-burning and white like rock crystal should be taken as pure (normal).</p>
<p>Ci30#145</p>
<p>Treatment of Disorders of Semen:</p>
<p>General Treatment of Disorders of Semen:</p>
<p>When semen becomes defective, it should be treated with aphrodisiac formulations which are easy to use and beneficial, the formulations alleviating raktapitta and those useful in female genital disorders.</p>
<p>Ci30#146</p>
<p>Ghee, milk, meat soup, sali rice, barley, wheat and sastika rice particularly application of enema is beneficial in defects of semen.</p>

<p>Diagnosis</p>
<p>Etiology Due to Loss of Semen Due to Loss of Penile Strength Due to Senility Due to Genetic Defect</p>
<p>Treatment General Treatment</p>
<p>Cause of Impotency:</p>
<p>&quot;As impotency caused by the defect of semen is cured by elimination of the defect itself, now I will describe as it.&quot; - Ci30#153</p>
<p>Due to loss of seed (semen) and penile strength, senility and deficiency of semen, impotency arises.</p>
<p>Ci30#154</p>
<p>General Symptoms of Impotency:</p>
<p>One constantly with firm determination does not cohabit even with beloved and submissive woman because of looseness of penis or if cohabits sometimes he starts panting with profuse perspiration, fruitless determination and effort, depressed penis and without semen.</p>
<p>Ci30#155-157</p>
<p>Causes of Impotency Due to Loss of Seed [Semen]:</p>
<p>Due to intake of cold, rough, little, mixed, incompatible and uncooked food; grief, anxiety, fear and terror, indulgence in women, exorcism, suspicion, deficiency of dhatus, imbalance of doshas, fasting, exertion, ignorance of the taste for women, faulty application of 5 evacuative measures, seed (semen) is impaired</p>
<p>Ci30#158-161</p>
<p>Symptoms of Impotency Due to Loss of Seed [Semen]:</p>
<p>and consequently the person becomes pale, too weak, of low vitality, with little erection to women, affected with cardiac disorder, anemia, bronchial asthma, jaundice, exhaustion, vomiting, diarrhea, colic, cough and fever.</p>
<p>Ci30#158-161</p>
<p>Symptoms of Impotency Due to Loss of Penile Strength:</p>
<p>Swelling, pain and redness in penis; appearance of acute boils, inflammation in penis, abnormal growth therein, appearance of ulcers with discharge like pulaka (rice) water or blackish or reddish in colour, ring-like hardness in circumference of the penis, fever, thirst, giddiness, fainting, vomiting, red, black, blue or violet discharge, burn-like intense sensation with pain &quot;in pelvis, testicles, suture and groins&quot;; sometimes there is slimy or pale discharge, mild swelling with feeling of wetness and little discharge, delayed inflammation and quick recovery; appearance of maggots, moisture, foul odor, necrosis of gland, penis and testicles.</p>
<p>Ci30#169-175</p>
<p>Thus is described the impotency due to loss of penile strength.</p>
<p>Some say it as 5 types.</p>
<p>Ci30#175</p>
<p>Causes of Impotency Due to Loss of Penile Strength: [put this in front of &#x27;symptoms&#x27;]</p>
<p>Due to intake of excessively sour, salty, alkaline, incompatible and unsuitable food; drinking too much water, irregular meals, intake of floury and heavy preparations, regular use of curd, milk, and meat of marshy animals, reduction from illness, coitus with female child and in non-vagina; cohabitation lustfuly and ignorantly with woman having chronic illness, left since long, in periods, with foul odour, having defective genital track and excessive discharge, intercourse with quadrupeds, injury to phallus, non-washing of penis, wound in penis by sharp instruments, teeth or nails, or its pressing or striking with</p>
<p>wooden stick, excessive use of awny insects (in order to elongate the organ) and holding back semen.</p>
<p>Ci30#162-168</p>
<p>Cause of Impotency Due to Senility:</p>
<p>Age is of 3 categories: inferior, average and superior.</p>
<p>Often semen is diminished in too old persons particularly due to deficiency of dhatus, not using aphrodisiacs, gradual decay of strength, energy and sensory as well as motor organs, deterioration in life-span, want of nutrition, physical exertion and mental exhaustion. Because of these factors, impotency arises in old age.</p>
<p>Ci30#176-178</p>
<p>Symptoms of Impotency Due to Senility:</p>
<p>The person becomes exceedingly wasted in dhatus, debilitated, devoid of normal complexion, with poor expression and falls prey to disease shortly.</p>
<p>Ci30#179-180</p>
<p>&quot;Now listen about the 4th one caused by deficiency (of semen).&quot;</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="cause-and-symptoms-of-impotency-due-to-loss-of-semen">Cause [and Symptoms] of Impotency Due to Loss of Semen:<a href="#cause-and-symptoms-of-impotency-due-to-loss-of-semen" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cause [and Symptoms] of Impotency Due to Loss of Semen:" title="Direct link to Cause [and Symptoms] of Impotency Due to Loss of Semen:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Due to excessive mental work, grief, anger, fear, envy, curiosity, intoxication and agitation, regular use of rough diet and drugs by the emaciated one, fasting by the debilitated one and intake of little food:</p>
<p>Rasa, the chief of the dhatus, located in the heart, is diminished quickly resulting in deficiency of other dhatus beginning with blood and ending with semen.</p>
<p>Of them, semen is the excellent resort.</p>
<p>Or, if one indulges in intercourse due to over-exhilaration of the mind [lust], his semen is diminished and he is reduced.</p>
<p>Consequently he falls prey to some severe disease or even death.</p>
<p>Hence one, desirous of health, should particularly protect the semen.</p>
<p>Ci30#181-185</p>
<p>&quot;Thus four-fold impotency is described.&quot;</p>
<p>Ci30#186</p>
<p>Some say 2 types of impotency as incurable and also by excision of penis and castration.</p>
<p>[[There are 2 types of incurable impotency, in addition to excision of penis and castration, which also cause incurable impotency.]]</p>
<p>Ci30#187</p>
<p>Cause and Symptoms of Impotency Due to Genetic Defect:</p>
<p>Due to genetic defect of parents and inauspicious past deeds, when dosas, in fetus, having reached the semen-carrying vessels dry them up resulting in destruction of semen, the man even though endowed fully with all the organs behaves like a non-man.</p>
<p>Ci30#188-189</p>
<p>These [which?] are said as incurable due to aggravation of sannipata.</p>

<p>Whatever remedy is mentioned for the defects of semen as well as wasting due to chest wound should be applied.</p>
<p>Ci30#191-192</p>
<p>One, knowing drugs and time, should apply enemas, ghee extracted from milk, aphrodisiac and rasayana formulations to treat impotency.</p>

<p>Diagnosis Etiology Symptoms Signs of Normal Menstrual Flow</p>
<p>Treatment General Treatment</p>
<p>&quot;Menorrhagia has been said earlier.&quot;</p>
<p>Synonyms for Pradara:</p>
<p>&quot;The experts of the treatise named it as &#x27;asrgdara&#x27; because menstrual flow is increased and discharged excessively.&quot;</p>
<p>Ci30#208</p>
<p>Symptoms of Menorrhagia:</p>
<p>Menstrual flow is increased and discharged excessively.</p>
<p>Ci30#208</p>
<p>Cause of Menorrhagia:</p>
<p>Taking excessively salty, sour, heavy, pungent, burning and fatty things, fatty meat of domestic and aquatic animals, krsara (rice cooked with pulse), payasa (rice cooked with milk), curd, sukta (vinegar), curd water, wine etc. V gets vitiated and blood also crosses its limit of quantity. - Ci30#205-206</p>
<p>Such V reaching the menses-caryying vessels in uterus takes along the blood and increases the quantity of menstrual flow thereby.</p>
<p>Ci30#207</p>
<p>The 4Types of Pradara:</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>P</p>
<p>K</p>

<p>Ci30#209</p>
<p>Cause of V pradara:</p>
<p>When V is vitiated due to intake of rough things etc. &quot; and taking along rakta&quot;.</p>
<p>Ci30#211</p>
<p>Symptoms of V pradara:</p>
<p>The menstrual discharge is frothy, thin, rough, blackish, reddish, &quot;stimulating&quot; [simulating [&quot; which looks like&quot; ] water of palasa flowers;</p>
<p>may be with or without pain;</p>
<p>there is intense pain in waist, groin, cardiac region, sides, back and pelvis.</p>
<p>Ci30#212-215</p>
<p>Cause of P Pradara:</p>
<p>When P vitiated by intake of sour, hot, salty and alkaline things cause pradara in the above way.</p>
<p>Ci30#216</p>
<p>Symptoms of P Pradara:</p>

<p>discharge is frequent and painful, associated with burning sensation, redness, thirst, mental confusion, fever and giddiness.</p>
<p>Ci30#218-219</p>
<p>Cause of K Pradara:</p>
<p>When K is vitiated by intake of heavy things etc. it causes K pradara.</p>
<p>Ci30#220</p>
<p>Symptoms of K pradara:</p>
<p>Menstrual blood flows out as slimy, pale, heavy, unctuous, cold, and viscous with mild pain.</p>
<p>This is associated with vomiting, anorexia, nausea, dyspnea and cough. Ci30#221</p>
<p>Cause And Symptoms of Sannipata Asrgdara:</p>
<p>When a woman exceedingly ill and anemic indulges in all the etiological factors, intensely aggravated V pushes out K with attenuated strength and burnt with the heat of P through the passage of blood (vagina) as fetid, slimy and yellow.</p>
<p>When it [V?/ menstrual flow?]carries away with force muscle-fat and fat and passes out constantly through vagina discharge simulating ghee, marrow and muscle-fat and she herself is anemic, weak and associated with thirst, burning sensation and fever, this is sannipatika type.</p>

<p>Due to the above causes, the aggravated V having been obstructed in it&#x27;s passage by aggravated blood affects the entire blood. - Ci29#10</p>
<p>Due to subtleness and pervasiveness of V and liquidity and flowingness of blood it circulates all over the body through the blood vessels.</p>
<p>Being obstructed in joints due to zigzag way it gets located there with agitation.</p>
<p>There may be involvement of P and K also, causing respective afflictions. -</p>

<p>Ci29#15, 12</p>
<p>Prodromal Symptoms of Vatarakta:</p>
<p>Excess or absence of perspiration, blackness, anesthesia, severe pain on injury, laxity in joints, lassitude, malaise, appearance of boils, piercing pain, quivering, tearing, heaviness, numbness and itching in knee, shanks, thigh, waist, shoulder, hands, feet and joints of body; unstable pain in joints, abnormal complexion and appearance of patches.</p>

<p>1.28Kg- ghee</p>
<p>1.28Kg.- oil</p>
<p>1.28Kg.- marrow derived mainly from marshy animals and birds</p>
<p>Prepare all the above together and cool.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>320gm.- bee&#x27;s wax</p>
<p>Mix all the above together.</p>
<p>Ci29#141-142</p>
<p>Treatment of Vatarakta Predominant in K:</p>
<p>Treatment in predominance of K and swelling, heaviness, itching etc.:</p>
<p>Ghee cooked with urine, alkali and wine is useful as massage.</p>
<p>Ci29#143</p>
<p>Ghee cooked with padmaka, twak, madhuka and sariva along with madhusukta (a type of vinegar) is useful as sprinkling sprinkling and massage in predominance of K.</p>
<p>Ci29#144</p>
<p>Alkali, oil, cow&#x27;s urine and ghee processed with pungent drugs are beneficial in vatarakta with predominance of K.</p>
<p>Ci29#145</p>
<p>Similarly, paste of mustard, nimba, arka, himsra, milk and sesamum or that of kapittha bark, ghee and milk mixed with parched grain flour is useful.</p>
<p>Ci29#146</p>
<p>Treatment of Vatarakta Predominant in V and K:</p>
<p>Soot, vaca, kustha, satahva, haridra, daruharidra- this paste alleviates pain in vatarakta predominant in V and K.</p>

<p>Ci29#148</p>
<p>Similarly, the seeds of madhusigru pounded with sour gruel are pasted for a while and then washed with sour liquids for treating cases predominant in V and K.</p>
<p>Ci29#149</p>
<p>The following paste is very efficacious in pain of vatarakta even caused by all the doshas [jointly]:</p>
<p>Equal quantity of each- triphala, trikatu, patra, ela, tvakksiri, citraka, vaca, vidanga, pippalimula, kasisa, vasa bark, rddhi, tamalaki, cavya</p>
<p>Pound all the above together.</p>

<p>Curd, sukta (vinegar), alkali and incompatible [heating and channel-blocking] food items should be avoided.</p>
<p>Ci29#154</p>
<p>The above treatment [referring to just the single formula above] should be applied by one conversant in reasoning and variation after considering specific positions and strength or otherwise of dosas. [The above formula might aggravate a pure V type or pure P type pain.]</p>
<p>Ci29#155</p>
<p>Treatment of V vitiated due to Blockage of Passage by Excessive aggravation of Medas and K:</p>
<p>Unction and bulk-promoting measures should not be applied in the beginning. Instead, K and medas should be diminished with physical exercises, evacuation, intake of arista and urine, purgation and administration of buttermilk and haritaki.</p>
<p>Ci29#156-157</p>
<p>One should take decoction of aswattha with honey. It overcomes shortly even the severe vatarakta caused by 3 doshas [together].</p>
<p>Ci29#158</p>
<p>Besides (K and medas should be diminished) by use of old cereals of barley and wheat, sidhu, arista, sura, asava (fermented beverage), silajatu, guggulu and maksika.</p>
<p>Ci29#159</p>
<p>Treatment of the deep type of the disease, when the blood is affected:</p>
<p>In the deep type of the disease if blood is affected, it should be treated like V. Thereafter steps should be taken to pacify vatarakta.</p>
<p>Ci29#160</p>
<p>Treatment of joint/ body part with inflammation or torn, discharging blood or immature pus:</p>
<p>The disordered part, due to excessive aggravation of rakta and P, gets inflamed or torn discharging blood or immature pus.</p>
<p>They should be treated with incision, cleansing and healing application. Ci29#161</p>
<p>Treatment/ Management of the Complications of Vatarakta:</p>
<p>&quot;The complications should be managed according to their respective treatment.&quot; So, see the other sections in this text pertaining to treatment of those disorders. Ci29#162</p>

<p>When in a person indulged in dirty food and having himself covered with rajas and tamas, the vitiated dosas, singly or in combination, obstruct the channels carrying rakta, rasa and consciousness and are located there, they give rise to diseases– &quot;mada&quot; (narcosis) [Note: not &quot;unmada&quot; (insanity)], &quot;murchha&quot; (fainting) and &quot;samnyasa&quot; (coma). Su24#25-29 [Note: P.V. Sharma has spelled the sanskrit word for fainting alternately as &quot;murchha&quot; or &quot;murccha&quot;.]</p>

<p>The person should be diagnosed as a case of V-type mada, if his speech is adherent, excessive and fast, movement is unstable and falling, and face is rough, reddish or blackish.</p>
<p>The person with angry and harsh speech, inclination towards beating and quarrels, and red, yellow and black face should be known as a case of P-type mada.</p>
<p>The person affected with K-type mada has little and incoherent speech, drowsiness and lassitude, paleness and continued concentration.</p>
<p>In sannipatika-type mada, all these features are found. Su24#30-32</p>
<p>This narcosis arises and subsides quickly like the alcoholic narcosis. Su24#33</p>
<p>All types of narcosis– caused by alcoholic drinks, poisons or blood– do not occur except by the vitiation of the 3 dosas V, P and K.</p>

<p>In V-type murchha (fainting), the patient becomes unconscious seeing the sky as blue, black or reddish and recovers quickly. Other symptoms are trembling, body-ache, excessive pain in cardiac region, emaciation, blackish and reddish lustre.</p>
<p>In P-type murchha, unconsciousness comes after seeing the sky as red, green or yellow and recovery is with sweating. There are also symptoms like thirst, pyrexia, red or yellow disturbed eyes, loose motions and yellow face.</p>
<p>The patient of K-type murchha, gets unconscious after seeing the sky like clouds or covered with deep darkness and recovers after a long time. He feels his body parts heavy and as wrapped with wet hide. He also suffers from excessive salivation and nausea.</p>
<p>Sannipata-type murchha has got the characters of all the above types and attacks in paroxysm like epilepsy with the difference that in this (murchha)_ the patient falls down without disgusting movement.</p>

<p>Mada and murccha subside on their own accord when the dosas finish their attack but samnyasa (coma) does not subside without medicines.</p>
<p>In weak persons, when very strong dosas get located in the abode of vital breath (heart) and affect the movement of speech, body and mind, coma ensues. The person affected with coma looks stick-like and as dead and immediately succumbs to death if the emergency is not managed quickly. As a wise person brings out the utensil drowning in deep water quickly before it settles down to the bottom of the ocean, the physician should manage the patient suffering from coma [expediently].</p>

<p>For arousing him from the deep slumber, collyriums, drops, smokes, blowing, needling, burning, pain in nail bed, plucking the hairs of head and body, biting with teeth, rubbing with hairy fruits of atmagupta are useful. Besides, various types of strong alcoholic liquors added with plenty of pungent substances should be poured into his mouth frequently. Similarly, the juice of matulunga added with dry ginger and sauvarcala salt combined with hingu along with wine, sour juice or vinegar should be administered for arousing consciousness.</p>
<p>When the patient regains consciousness he should be given light diet and during this period he should be entertained with surprising narratives, memoirs, pleasing talks, enchanting songs and playing of musical instruments and colorful scenery [to keep him from falling back into coma]. Moreover, he should be treated with purgation, emesis, smoking, collyrium, gargles blood-letting and rubbing all over the body.

<p>In case the K gulma does not subside even after lightening, vomiting, fomentation, intake of ghee, purgatives, enema, pills, powders, alkali and aristas, then cauterization should be done.</p>
<p>Cauterization should be done with &quot;arrow-iron&quot; etc..</p>

Still later Prsadhra started sacrificing bulls when other animals were not available for his long term sacrificial rite. On seeing this the creatures became shocked and when in this afflicted mental state and consequent loss of agni they ingested the killed bulls, it caused diarrhea due to heaviness, hotness, unsuitability and use of inauspicious thing.

<p>O Agnivesa! Listen well about the etiology, pathogenic materials, signs and symptoms, location and treatment of leprosy and other skin disorders which are particularly damaging for the skin (including touch sensation).</p>
<p>Ci7#3</p>
<p>Seven materials affected morbidly are the causative source of kustha such as the 3 doshas vitiated by etiological factors and the 4 dusya sariradhatus (twak, mamssa, rakta and lasika [rakta]) affected with affliction by dosas.</p>
<p>These 7 materials, in this way, are causative factors of 7 types of kustha.</p>
<p>Arising from this source they afflict the whole body.</p>
<p>Ni5#3</p>
<p>There is no kustha which is caused by vitiation of [only] one dosha.</p>
<p>However, the types of kustha having similar etiological source have difference in pain, color, symptoms, effects, name and treatment according to proportional variation, association and location of doshas.</p>
<p>Thus it is of 7 types, 18 types or innumerable variations in disorders except in case of incurable ones.</p>
<p>Considering the exhaustiveness of variations (of dosas) and resultant disorders I shall describe only the 7 types of kustha.</p>
<p>Ni5#4</p>
<p>In case of vitiation of 3 doshas and affection therewith of the 4 dusyas (twak etc.), if V is predominant kapalakustha arises.</p>
<p>In predominance of P, &#x27;Audumara&#x27; arises.</p>
<p>In predominance of K, Mandalakkustha arises.</p>
<p>In V-P, Rsyajihva arises.</p>
<p>In P-K, Pundarika arises.</p>
<p>In K-V, Sidhmakustha arises.</p>
<p>In Sannipatika, Kakanaka arises.</p>

<p>These 7-fold disorders, in view of comparative and superlative degrees in etiological source attains a larger number of variations of the disorders.</p>

<p>without vomiting the burnt (excessively acid) food again takes food of similar nature, suppresses the urge of vomiting, applies too much unction, the 3 doshas are vitiated simultaneously and the 4 dusyas (twak etc.) attain laxity.</p>
<p>Thus the vitiated doshas getting accommodation in those tissues and staying therein affect those twak etc. morbidly and thus give rise to kusthas.</p>

<p>Here, what is incurable does not give up the incurability, however, some of the curables, sometimes transgress their curability due to unwholesome regimen.</p>
<p>The 6 curable ones except Kakanaka attain incurability if they are not treated or the unwholesome regimen is followed which leads them to the condition of &#x27;abhisyanda&#x27; by doshas.</p>
<p>Ni5#9</p>
<p>Even the curable ones when neglected give rise to maggots born in the skin, muscle, blood, lymph, slough, discharge and sweat.</p>
<p>They eat up the skin etc. and dosas further affecting cause these complications separately.</p>
<p>Thus, V causes blackish and reddish color, coarseness, roughness, pain, wasting, piercing pain, tremors, horripilation, contraction, exhaustion, stiffness, numbness, decay and breaking down;</p>
<p>P causes heat, sweat, moistening, sloughing, discharge, suppuration and redness,</p>
<p>K causes whiteness, coldness, itching, immobility, heaviness, protuberance, unctuousness and plastering, maggots eat up the 4 skin etc, veins, ligaments and cartilages.</p>
<p>In this condition these complications afflict the patient of kustha such as- profuse discharge, decay of body parts, falling down of body parts along with thirst, fever, diarrhea, burning sensation, debility, anorexia and indigestion.</p>
<p>Such types of kustha should be known as incurable.</p>
<p>Ni5#10</p>
<p>&#x27;Here are the verses&#x27;-</p>
<p>The person who neglects the disease in early stage considering it as curable is regarded as if dead after a lapse of time.</p>
<p>One who applies remedy properly prior to the disease or in it&#x27;s early stage, enjoys happiness for long.</p>
<p>As a young tree is cut with a little effort but the same requires great effort when fully grown, Likewise, the newly born disorder is cured easily while the much advanced one is cured with difficulty or becomes incurable.</p>

<h1>Topical Treatment of Kustha:</h1>
<p>Note: the medicines applied externally exhibit quick effect after the impurity of blood is eliminated and thus the seat of morbidity is evacuated.</p>

<p>Diseased spots which are stable, hard and patchy &quot;should be fomented by means of a stone-slab and tubes and thereafter rubbed with a brush&quot;.</p>
<p>In this way, the morbidity of blood should be removed.</p>
<p>Such a spot may alto be fomented with the bundle of meat of marshy and aquatic animals slightly heated and then scraped with a sharp instrument so that blood comes out or for this purpose horn or bottle gourd may also be applied.</p>
<p>Ci7#50-51</p>
<p>In case of minor disorder, the spot should be scarified or leeches should be applied for evacuation of (impure) blood.</p>
<p>Ci7#52</p>
<p>In case where surgical interferenc3e is not fit and the spots are anaesthetic, alkali should be applied after elimination of blood and the associated dosha.</p>
<p>If the spot which is stony hard, rough, benumbed, stable and old, the patient should be advised to take some antipoison drug and then the spot should be anointed with some poison followed by anti-poison drug.</p>
<p>Ci7#54-55</p>
<p>The leprotic spots which are stiff, exceedingly anaesthetic, without perspiration and itching should be rubbed with the brush of danti, trivrta, karavira, karanja or leaves of jati, arka or nimba, or some instrument or dried cowdung piece before application of an ointment.</p>

<p>Many diseases arise from defect of Agni (power of digestion), but Udararoga especially so.</p>
<p>The defective state of agni is due to increases of malas (the excrements, urines and sweat, as well as the 3 doshas).</p>
<p>In this condition of insufficient agni, if unwholesome food is taken, this food is not digested properly and leads to accumulation of dosas.</p>
<p>&quot;These accumulated dosas affect prana, agni and apana, and blocking upward and downward passages reaches the interspace between skin and muscle and blows up the abdomen [ascites]].&quot;</p>
<p>Thus udararoga is produced.</p>

<p>Ci13#35</p>
<p>Pathology of Spleen-enlargement type of Udararoga:</p>
<p>(As Well As Signs of Splenomegaly):</p>
<p>Due to the above etiological factors, &quot;the spleen located in the left side gets displaced from it&#x27;s normal place and thus is enlarged or the blood increased (accumulated) through rasa etc. [the dhatus] also enlarge it.&quot;</p>
<p>The (enlarged) spleen is initially hard and like a small stony piece .</p>
<p>It gradually increases and becomes like a tortoise.</p>

<li class="">1)&quot;In initial stage it is devoid of complications and accumulation of fluid and then itself one should treat it quickly.&quot;</li>
<li class="">2)If neglected, the dosas moved away from their own place and liquefied due to process of ripening moisten the joints and channels.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="">3)The sweat too is obstructed in it&#x27;s passage to outward channels and thus staying obliquely adds to the same fluid.</li>
<li class="">4)Thus there appears &quot;piccha&quot; (slime)on which the abdomen becomes round, heavy, still, dull on percussion, soft on palpation, streak-less (on inspection) and concentrating on the umbilicus itself.</li>
<li class="">5)Thereafter fluid appears which exhibits the following signs- excessive enlargement of abdomen, disappearance of veins and feeling of fluctuation on palpation like that in a bag full of water.</li>
</ul>
<p>[Note: consider working all following info into a &quot;prognosis&quot; chart. The following &quot;complications&quot; paragraph should be duplicated.]</p>

<p>Complications Which Manifest In [Udakodara(Ascites)/ Udararoga in general]:</p>
<p>vomiting, diarrhea, feeling of darkness, thirst, dyspnea, cough, hiccup, debility, pain in sides, anorexia, hoarseness of voice, retention of urine etc.</p>
<p>Such patient should be declared as incurable.</p>
<p>Ci13#49</p>
<p>Prognosis of Udararoga:</p>
<p>Udararoga caused by V, P, K, spleen, sannipata and fluid are increasingly severe in progressive order (so V type is least, fluid type is most).</p>
<p>The Obstructive Abdomen Type is mostly fatal after a fortnight [[14 days]].</p>
<p>All the types attaining fluid including the Perforative Abdomen Type are mostly fatal after a fortnight [[14 days]].</p>
<p>One should reject the patient having swollen eyes, crooked private parts, moistened thin skin and loss of strength, blood, flesh and digestive power.</p>
<p>Ci13#50-51</p>
<p>For the patient of udararoga, swelling in all the vital parts [simultaneously], dyspnea, hiccup, anorexia, thirst, fainting, vomiting and diarrhea are fatal.</p>
<p>&quot;Udararoga as a whole is often the most difficult [of all diseases] to be treated from the very start.&quot;</p>
<p>[It is difficult, even in the early stages to treat udararoga.]</p>
<p>However it can be cured with effort if it is newly arisen, fluid-less and the patient is strong.</p>
<p>That type of Udararoga which is devoid of fluid may be treated (according to strength and dusya, etc.).</p>
<p>Ci13#52-54, Ci13#58</p>
<p>Signs and Symptoms of Udararoga Devoid of Fluid:</p>
<p>the abdomen does not have swelling</p>
<p>the abdomen [is (vs. is not)] reddish, and resonant on percussion</p>
<p>the abdomen is &quot;not very hevy&quot;</p>
<p>[is] always with gurgling sound</p>
<p>full of venous network</p>
<p>V distending the navel and disappearing after impelling the urge</p>
<p>pain in heart, navel, groin, waist and anus passing hard flatus digestive fire not very mild [it has not been excessively weakened] tastelessness in mouth due to salivation scanty urine hard stool Ci13#55-58</p>

<p>Treatment of &quot;Vatodara&quot; (V Type of Udararoga) [The following Information Also Applies To Treatment of Udararoga In General]:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">1)V Type Udararoga- (if in a strong patient) treat at first with uncting substances.[time scale is? Earlier in the day that step 2 is done? 2 days prior? Every day for 1-4 weeks prior to step 2?]</li>
<li class="">2)After unction and fomentation, administer uncted purgations. [time scale is 1 action in 1 day]</li>
</ul>
<p>When properly done, these purgations should eliminate the dosa and cause the abdomen to recede.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">3)Wrap the abdomen with cloth piece (bandage) so that V may not blow it up again due to want of vacuum.</li>
<li class="">4)Udararoga is originated by excessive accumulations of dosas and obstruction in passage of channels, hence the patient should be purged daily. [time scale is 1 action for several days]</li>
</ul>
<p>[step 1 through 3 should be repeated every day to satisfy step 4&#x27;s requirements]</p>
<p>5)After he is evacuated and managed with proper diet, he should be given milk for promoting strength. [time frame is? every day after step 4? only after the last purgative in the sequence of days has been completed? toward the end of the sequence of purgatives? After purgative sequence and after lightening diet period?]</p>
<p>When this purpose is served (patient is strengthened somewhat), the milk should be withdrawn gradually before it produces nausea.</p>

<p>[Note the times that each milk takes to succeed. This indicates their ratio of &quot;roughness&quot; quality; camel&#x27;s milk is 3x rougher than goat&#x27;s milk.

<p>For piles caused by V and K there is no better remedy than buttermilk.</p>
<p>The piles destroyed once by buttermilk do not recur.</p>
<p>Buttermilk poured on the ground eradicates even the deep-rooted grasses; needless to say it can also eradicate dry piles in persons having stimulated digestive fire.</p>
<p>Rasa [dhatu] which comes forth in the channels cleared by buttermilk gives rise to corpulence, strength, complexion and pleasure.</p>
<p>Buttermilk also alleviates besides piles the 100 disorders of V and K (80 disorders of V and 20 disorders of K).</p>
<p>Thus there is no remedy better than buttermilk for the disorders caused by K and V.</p>
<p>Ci14#76-88</p>

<p>Treatment of Bleeding Piles:</p>
<p>Hereafter will be a few pages for treatment of bleeding-type piles.</p>
<p>Here there are 2 types of association of dosas- one of K and the other of V.</p>
<p>Ci14#171</p>
<p>Symptoms of V-type of Bleeding Piles:</p>
<p>Stool which is blackish, hard and rough, not passing flatus,</p>
<p>the blood coming out of the piles as thin, reddish and frothy;</p>
<p>pain in the waist, thighs and anorectum,</p>
<p>extreme debility and</p>
<p>[history of] roughening etiological factors [is revealed on questioning]</p>
<p>Ci14#172-173</p>
<p>Symptoms of K-type of Bleeding Piles:</p>
<p>stool is loose, white-yellow, unctuous, heavy and cold;</p>

<p>Ci14#178-179</p>
<p>Importance of Not Prematurely Stopping Bleeding of Piles:</p>
<p>If the discharged blood is checked at the very outset, that impure blood caused many diseases such as raktapitta, fever, thirst, sluggishness of digestion, anorexia, jaundice, swelling and pain in anorectum and groins; itching, pimples, allergic eruptions, boils, leprosy, anemia, retention of flatus, urine ands stool headache, feeling of cold, heaviness in body and other blood disorders.</p>
<p>Hence checking of blood is desirable only after the impure blood is let out.</p>
<p>The physician acquainted with the etiology, symptoms, time, strength and blood colors should ignore it till there is emergency.</p>
<p>Ci14#180</p>
<p>Treatment of Bleeding Piles (after right intervening time):</p>
<p>Thereafter one should manage the case with bitters in order to stimulate digestive fire, to check blood and to help digestion of dosas.</p>

<p>Treatment of the bleeding which persists in the patient with diminished morbidity and aggravated V:</p>
<p>Manage with unction in the forms of intake, massage and unctuous enema. Ci14#182</p>
<p>Treatment of Piles with P-predominance, in summer season, with little V or K:</p>

<p>The particular dusyas involved in prameha are: abundant and non-compact medas [fat] and muscle; as well as body fluid, semen, blood, muscle-fat, marrow, &#x27;lasika&#x27; [rakta?], rasa and ojas.</p>

<p>By combination of these 3 factors (nidana [etiology], dosha, dusya), K gets vitiated immediately because of the predominance of it&#x27;s aggravating factors.</p>
<p>When vitiated it spreads all over the body immediately due to laxity of the body. [-an important concept to grasp; &quot;laxity&quot; of tissues.]</p>
<p>While spreading at first it gets mixed up with the fat because fat is abundant, noncompact and similar in properties.</p>
<p>While mixing up K affects it morbidly due to it&#x27;s vitiation.</p>
<p>Next that vitiated K associated with fat joins with body fluid and muscle because the latter are increased excessively.</p>
<p>Thus affecting the muscle, it produces boils, saravika, kacchapika etc. due to sloughing of muscle because of abnormalcy.</p>
<p>By affecting the body fluid, transforms it into urine and also blocks the heavy openings of the urinary tubules coming out from vanksana (urinary bladder) and basti (kidney) and associated with fat and fluid.</p>
<p>Thus it (K) produces the (K-type) pramehas and leads to their stability or incurability, due to abnormalcy.</p>

<p>Etiology/ Pathology of P-type of Prameha:</p>
<p>P causes the same situation, when it is aggravated by hot things.</p>
<p>Ci6#5</p>
<p>Etiology/ Pathology of V-type of Prameha:</p>
<p>V gets aggravated when the other 2 doshas have become relatively diminished. It then &quot;draws on the dhatus in the urinary bladder and thus caused pramehas.&quot; [Agnivesha has mentioned twice in this chapter that V has been aggravated because of the diminution of the other 2 doshas. This is somewhat different from the usual concern of plain V increase.]</p>
<p>Ci6#5</p>
<p>Number and Division of Prameha Types:</p>
<p>There are a total of 20 types of Pramehas:</p>
<p>K- has 10 types of prameha P- has 6 types of prameha V- has 4 types of prameha Ci6#7</p>
<p>&quot;Thus 24 types of prameha caused by vitiation of the 3 doshas have been described in this chapter.&quot;</p>

<p>Importance of Primarily Treating Body Fluid, Fat and K:</p>
<p>Body fluid, fat and K are the causes of prameha.</p>
<p>Therefore, the first step in treatment of K and P types of prameha should be desaturation measures.</p>
<p>Ci6#51</p>
<p>Avoidance of Etiological Factors:</p>
<p>the treatment of a disease starts with avoiding the etiological factors.</p>
<p>So, avoid the etiological factors in treatment.</p>
<p>Ci6#53</p>
<p>[move the following paragraphs to the beginning of this Prameha chapter.] Diagnosis:</p>
<p>Differentiation of Prameha and Raktapitta:</p>
<p>One who passes deep-yellow or bloody urine without exhibiting premonitory symptoms of prameha should be diagnosed as raktapitta instead.</p>
<p>Ci6#54</p>
<p>Differentiation of V-type Prameha and K prameha:</p>
<p>If the urine is sweet, slimy and honey-like, then either of the following are possibilities:</p>
<p>A) it is V-type prameha (this type is caused by diminution of the doshas) [Here the sliminess in the urine is the diminishing soft tissues exiting via the urine.]</p>
<p>B) is it K-type prameha (this type is due to over-saturation)</p>
<p>[Here the sliminess in the urine is the excess soft doshas welling over from the blood stream into the urine.]</p>
<p>Ci6#55</p>
<p>Prognosis:</p>
<p>&quot;K and P pramehas having premonitory symptoms, and V pramehas developed by their own factors are incurable.</p>
<p>The P pramehas (without premonitory symptoms) are maintainable, and if fat is not excessively affected.</p>
<p>Ci6#56</p>
<p>Prognosis of Congenital Prameha:</p>
<p>congenital diabetes, or one inheriting the disease from his diabetic father is incurable because of the genetic defect.</p>

<p>The teacher Punarvasu, the abode of intellect, memory, knowledge and penance, and savior of living beings, described the etiology, symptoms and treatment of insanity to Agnivesa concisely as queried.</p>
<p>Ci9#3</p>
<h1>Definition of Insanity:</h1>
<p>Excessive wandering of intellect, mind and memory.</p>
<p>Ci9#8</p>
<p>Insanity is defined as wandering about of mind, intellect, consciousness, knowledge, memory, inclination, manners, activities and conduct.</p>
<p>Ni7#5</p>
<h1>Etiological Factors of Insanity:</h1>
<p>antagonistic, defective and impure food insulting the gods, teachers or brahmanas mental shock due to gear or exhilaration difficult postures</p>
<p>Ci9#4</p>
<h1>Etiology of Insanity [doshic or non-exogenous type]:</h1>
<p>The 4 types caused by doshas arise shortly in persons like these such as- in timid, those with distressed mind and aggravated doshas, who use dirty, damaged, and unsuitable food items irregularly observing the rules for dieting , apply tantrika practices improperly, practice other body postures in a complicated way, are extremely emaciated, having giddiness due to intensity of (other) diseases, whose mind is inflicted by passion, anger, greed, exhilaration, fear, confusion, exhaustion, grief, anxiety, excitement etc. and in those who are frequently injured or whose mind gets damaged and intellect becomes unstable, in this state the aggravated dosas spreading to the heart and obstructing the mind-carrying channels give rise to insanity.</p>
<p>Ni7#4</p>
<h1>Pathology of Insanity:</h1>
<p>The causative factors vitiate the doshas in the person.</p>
<p>Those people with only a small proportion of Sattva (guna) are most susceptible to this.</p>
<p>The aggravated doshas affect hrdaya, the seat of intellect.</p>
<p>From the heart, the doshas reach the mind-carrying channels.</p>
<p>Thus the doshas quickly derange the mind of the person.</p>

<p>Ci9#22</p>
<h1>Sings of Insanity caused by Longing for Pleasure or Worship:</h1>
<p>Those maddened by longing for pleasure or worship should be know by their liking [so just ask them].</p>
<p>Ci9#23</p>
<p>&quot;There is 3-fold object in insaning by insanity-producing agents&quot; [clarify the preceding], such as: violence, pleasure and worship.&quot;</p>
<p>Their specific object should be known by observing the specific behavior of the insane.</p>
<p>If inflicted with the violent one, the patient enters into fire, sinks into water, falls into a pit from the ground; strikes himself with weapon, whip, wooden stick, brickbats and fist; and takes other suicidal action. He should be known as incurable, while the other 2 are curable.</p>

<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="treatment-5">Treatment:<a href="#treatment-5" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Treatment:" title="Direct link to Treatment:" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Remedial measures for the curable 2 types are as follows:</p>
<p>recitation of mantras, wearing of roots and gems, auspicious rites, offerings, gifts, oblations, religious rules, vow, propitiation, fasting, blessings, prostration, visit to religious places etc.</p>
<p>Ni7#16</p>
<p>Thus the 5 types of insanity are described. - Ni7#17</p>
<p>Although 5 they are in fact 2 while being divided as innate in exogenous, and curable and in-curable.</p>
<p>They, however, associate with each other by combination of respective causes.</p>
<p>Then they have combined prodroma as well as symptoms.</p>
<p>Amongst them, combination of incurable ones, and curable and incurable ones should be known as incurable while the combination of curable ones is curable. It&#x27;s treatment also consists of the combination of therapeutic measures.</p>
<p>Ni7#18</p>
<p>Neither the gods, nor the gandharvas, nor pisacas, nor raksasas, nor others inflict a person who is himself unaffected (by his own deeds).</p>
<p>When these associate with the person afflicted by his own deeds, that affliction is (evidently) not caused by them nor is there any sense of accomplishment by them.</p>
<p>Ni7#19-20</p>
<p>One should not implicate infliction from the gods, forefathers or raksasas in case of a disease caused by one&#x27;s own deeds through intellectual error.</p>
<p>One should regard himself as the doer of happiness and unhappiness, hence one should follow the propitious path without any fear.</p>
<p>Worship of the gods etc. and use of wholesome things, the gods etc. and antagonism with them– all this depends on one&#x27;s own self.</p>

<p><strong>Plus important directions for smoking apparatus using earthen saucers which has been briefly mentioned elsewhere in the text:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The physician should advise smoking to the patients of cough and coryza in conditions of headache, nasal catarrh and weakness of the heart.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;The patient of cough should apply evacuative smoking orally [by mouth] by putting a &quot;curved pipe&quot; 10 or 8 fingers [[finger widths]] into the hole of [[2] earthen saucer[s] joined together closely.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The smoke having reached the entire chest should be exhaled from the mouth.</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Exhalation through the nose causes eye damage.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Due to sharpness, the smoking detaches the phlegm situated in the chest and brings it out, and thus it relieves cough caused by V and K.</strong></p>
<p>Ci18#65-68</p>
<p>[The following is a single formula, not individual ingredients to be used in several formulas]:</p>
<p>&quot;One should apply smoking of realgar, orpiment, madhuka, mamsi, musta and inguda followed by drinks of warm milk added with jaggery. This smoking alleviates V, P, K and sannipatika types of cough <strong>even which are not cured by other 100 formulations</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>[The stick and paste has to be allowed to dry fully, so that all the water is evaporated and the stick is stiff.]</p>
<p>Use: smear the stick with ghee [so that it will stay lit, and for pacification of V] before smoking it.</p>
<p>After smoking, drink some milk or water + jaggery.</p>
<p>Ci18#71-72</p>

<h1>Historical/ Mythical Origin of Poison:</h1>
<p>&quot;While the ocean was being churned by gods and demons for [making] nectar, a human form which was fierce-looking and brilliant, with four large teeth, brown hairs and fiery eyes appeared before the origin of the nectar. The creatures were afflicted just by looking at him, and thus he was called &#x27;Visa&#x27; (poison).&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brahma (the creator) placed him [&#x27;Visa&#x27;] in <strong>two sources</strong>– mobile and immobile.</p>
<p>&quot;That <strong>originates from water</strong>, is of <strong>2 types</strong> and <strong>fire-like</strong> and has <strong>8 impulses</strong>, <strong>10 properties</strong> and <strong>24 remedial measures</strong>.</p>
<p>Ci23#6</p>
<p>&quot;Because of it&#x27;s watery source, it gets liquefied and flows like jaggery in rains but thereafter it is destroyed by Agastya (appearance of Agastya constellation in the sky) and as such <strong>poison becomes mild in action after the rainy season (in autumn)&quot;.</strong></p>

<h1><strong>Pathology/ Action of Poison:</strong></h1>
<p><strong>It vitiates V due to roughness</strong></p>
<p><strong>It vitiates P due to hotness</strong></p>
<p><strong>It vitiates rakta due to minuteness (quality of entering into fine channels)</strong></p>
<p><strong>It vitiates K and &#x27;annarasa (chyle)&#x27; due to undefined taste.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is absorbed quickly due to vyavayi [mobile] property.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It pervades the entire body due to &#x27;asu&#x27; (quick acting) property.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It effects the vital organs due to sharpness.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It effects the vital breath due to vikasi [&quot;depressant&quot; – but what is the definition I know for this word?] property.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is difficult to manage due to lightness.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It does not adhere to dosas due to non-slimy-ness. [and thus can not be evacuated along with dosas.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>And yet it aggravates/ vitiates any of the dosas due to it&#x27;s location and patient&#x27;s constitution.</strong></p>

<p>&#x27;Madya (wine)&#x27; having entered into the heart counteracts the 10 properties of ojas with it&#x27;s corresponding 10 properties and thus upsets the mind. - Ci24#28-29</p>
<p>The 10 properties are: light, hot, sharp, finely entering, sour, quickly absorbed, quick-acting, rough, &#x27;depressant&#x27; [[reducing]] and non-slimy. - Ci24#30</p>
<p><u>The 10 properties of Ojas are:</u> heavy, cold, soft, smooth, viscous, sweet, stable, clear, slimy and unctuous.</p>
<p>Wine counteracts the properties of ojas by it&#x27;s own properties such as heaviness by lightness, coldness by hotness, sweetness by sourness, softness by sharpness, clarity by quick action, unctuousness by roughness, stability by quick absorption, smoothness by depressant action, sliminess by non-sliminess and viscosity by subtleness.</p>
<p>Thus disturbing ojas, the mind gets affected quickly, which causes narcosis [unconsciousness].</p>
<p>Ci24#31-34</p>
<p>The heart is the seat of the channels of rasa, vata etc., psyche, intellect, senses, self and primary ojas.</p>

<p>Wine Made of Flour Does Not (Severely) Damage Ojas:</p>
<p>Note: &#x27;Such severe damage of ojas is not affected [caused] by wine made of flour, because the properties of depressentness, roughness and non-sliminess are not so aggravated therein.&#x27;</p>

<h1>The Necessity of Inducing Exhilaration:</h1>
<h1><strong>&#x27;Wine produces narcosis without unagitating the mind and unaffecting the body hence exhilarating measure is necessary.&#x27;</strong></h1>
<p>[This is probably an important concept, but I do not yet fully grasp it. I believe much of the list directly above is aimed at producing exhilaration for this purpose, but the reason why is not yet fully clear to me from this sentence. ]</p>
<p>[What it probably means is when someone is in narcosis due to wine (a stupor) his mind and body are un-responsive and sunken. Thus one should apply measures which revive him and re-engage him externally.]</p>

<p>In this disease, none of the unction, enema, purgation and emesis is applied because of the following reasons, listen:</p>
<p>Unction and enema lead to aggravation of K.</p>
<p>Purgation is not able to extricate K situated there [the small intestines].</p>
<p>It is easy to eliminate K and P situated in kaphasthana (stomach).</p>
<p>K and P can be eliminated by purgation if they are situated in &#x27;amasaya&#x27; [stomach].</p>
<p>Even all the dosas situated in &#x27;pakvasaya&#x27; [I thought this was colon] can be eliminated with enemas by striking at the root of morbidity.</p>
<p>But when the two (ama and K) are located in the seat of V [Pakvasaya/ colon] as they are stiffened due to it&#x27;s [their] coldness, they can not be extricated easily, just as water from a low ditch is hard to extricate.</p>

<h1>The 3 Steps in Treatment of All Types Parasites:</h1>
<p>Step I: the parasites should be extracted from the body.</p>
<p>Step II: the source of their origin and development (impure mucus etc.) should be destroyed</p>
<p>Step III: thereafter the patient should abstain from the etiological factors. Vi7#14</p>
<h1>General Therapeutic Application of the Above Concept:</h1>
<p>The 3-fold management which is mentioned in respect of parasites is applicable for controlling all disorders as well. <strong>Evacuation, pacification and avoidance of etiological factors– these 3 should be applied properly in every disease.</strong></p>
<p>Vi7#28-30</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="step-i--extraction-of-the-parasites">Step I- Extraction of the Parasites:<a href="#step-i--extraction-of-the-parasites" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step I- Extraction of the Parasites:" title="Direct link to Step I- Extraction of the Parasites:" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Extraction is removal effected by hands with or without the help of instruments as necessary. Parasites located inside the organs are extracted, as a rule, by the (eliminative) therapy [part or all of the pancha karma sequence]. This is of 4 types such as head evacuation, emesis, purgation and non-unctuous enema. This is the method of extraction.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="step-ii--destruction-of-the-source-of-their-origin">Step II- Destruction of the source of their origin:<a href="#step-ii--destruction-of-the-source-of-their-origin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step II- Destruction of the source of their origin:" title="Direct link to Step II- Destruction of the source of their origin:" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Destruction of the source of their origin and development consists of the use of pungent, bitter, astringent, alkaline and hot drugs, and other measures which are contrary to K and feces. This is about destruction of the source.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="step-iii--abstinence-from-the-etiological-factors">Step III- Abstinence from the etiological factors:<a href="#step-iii--abstinence-from-the-etiological-factors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step III- Abstinence from the etiological factors:" title="Direct link to Step III- Abstinence from the etiological factors:" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Thereafter abstinence from the etiological factors– whatever is mentioned as causative factor and similar other substances should be avoided.</p>
<p>Thus the principle of treatment by 3 stages has just been summarized. Treatment will now be described in detail:</p>
<p>Vi7#15</p>
<h1>[Step I- Extraction of the Parasites:]</h1>
<p>The patient infested with worms should be first treated with unction and fomentation for 6 or 7 nights [i.e. 6 or 7 days].</p>
<p>A day before administering the evacuative therapy he should be given a diet [meal] in morning and evening consisting mainly of milk, jaggery, curd, sesame, fish, meat of marshy animals, (rice) flour preparations, rice cooked in milk and kusumbha oil in order to stimulate the worms and impel them to the digestive tract. The next morning, when the patient is comfortably seated and has his meal [from the previous evening] properly digested, the evacuative therapy– non-unctuous enema, emesis and purgation– should be administered to him on the same day after examining all the aspects properly.</p>
<p>Vi7#16</p>
<p>Next the patient should be administered the following enema for 3 or 7 days:</p>
<p>mulaka, sarsapa, lasuna [garlic], karanja, sigru, madhusigru, kharapuspa, bhustrna, sumukha, surasa, kutheraka, gandira, kalamalaka, parnasa, ksavka phanijjaka– all or whichever are available</p>
<p>Cut the above into pieces, wash well with water, and put in a well-cleaned cooking pot.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>equal parts of- cow&#x27;s urine, water</p>
<p>Cook the above together, stirring constantly with a ladle.</p>
<p>When the water is mostly consumed and the drugs are well-extracted the cooking pot should be brought down [off the fire].</p>
<p>Filter properly.</p>
<p>Cool the decoction so it is still tolerably warm but not hot.</p>

<p>swarjika salt</p>
<p>Mix all of the above together.</p>
<p>Use: put into an enema pot and with this non-unctuous enema should be administered to the patient properly.</p>
<p>It should be administered to the patient for 3 or 7 days</p>
<p>Note: Charaka says &quot;the patient should be asked to bring the [above] drugs, all or whichever are available&quot;.</p>
<p>Vi7#17</p>
<p>The following is an alternate enema formula:</p>
<p>The above enema may be prepared also with decoction of- arka, alarka, kutaja, adhaki, kustha and kaidarya</p>
<p>Vi7#17</p>
<p>The following is an alternate enema formula:</p>
<p>The above enema may be prepared also with decoction of- sigru, pilu, dhanyaka, katuka and sarsapa</p>
<p>Vi7#17</p>
<p>The following is an alternate enema formula:</p>
<p>The above enema may be prepared also with decoction of- amalaka, srngabera,</p>
<p>daruharidra and nimba</p>
<p>Vi7#17</p>
<p>After the last enema has come back the patient should be assured and on the same day evacuative drugs acting both ways [emesis and purgation] should be administered to him properly.</p>
<p>Vi7#18</p>
<p>For this purpose, one should use the following emetic-purgative formula:</p>
<p>One aksa (10gm.) paste of- trivrt</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>½ anjali (80ml) decoction of- madanaphala pulp</p>
<p>Mix the above together.</p>
<p>Use: this formula should be administered to the patient; this eliminates the noxious material well from both ways.</p>
<p>Vi7#18</p>
<p>Creating other emetic-purgative formulas:</p>
<p>In the same way as the above formula, emetics and purgatives mentioned in the kalpa section [see section on emetic and purgative herbs] may be administered after taking into consideration all the aspects.</p>
<p>Vi7#18</p>
<p>When the patient is purged well, he should be bathed with the warm decoction of vidanga and he should use this for all purposes external as well as internal in place of water constantly; if it is not available, decoction of other pungent, bitter and astringent drugs or urine or alkalis may be used for bath. After bath he should be admitted to a room which is free from wind and should be managed with dietetic regimen starting with yavagu (liquid gruel) cooked with pippali, pippalimula, cavya, citraka and sunthi. In this way when he reaches the stage of vilepi (paste gruel) unctuous enema should be administered to him with vidangataila twice or thrice on alternate days [every other day].</p>
<p>Vi7#19</p>
<p>If too much aggravated worms (maggots) creating trouble in the head are observed and sometimes moving in that, then after applying unction and fomentation to the head the patient should be administered head evacuation with the seeds of apamarga etc.</p>
<p>Vi7#20</p>
<p>Now will be described some medicated food preparations for destroying the environment for growths of the parasites:</p>
<p>the whole plant of mulakaparni along with root, top and branches Cut the above into pieces, then pound in a mortar. Extract the juice out of it by pressing with the hands.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>flour of- red sali rice</p>
<p>Make the above into &quot;pupalika&quot; (cake [patty]).</p>
<p>These should be cooked on smokeless charcoal.</p>
<p>Use: these cakes alongwith vidanga, oil and salt should be given to the patient infested with parasites for eating.</p>
<p>Afterwards he should be given to drink the sour vinegar or diluted buttermilk mixed with 5 drugs of the pippalyadi group (pippali, pippalimula, cavya, citraka, sunthi) with a little salt.</p>
<p>Vi7#21</p>
<p>In the same way, cakes may be prepared in the juice of one of these drugs– bhrngaraja, arka, sahacara, nipa, nirgundi, sumukha, surasa, kutheraka, gandira, kalamalaka, parnasa, ksavaka, phanijjaka, bakula, kutaja and suvarnaksiri.</p>
<p>Vi7#21</p>
<p>Moreover, cakes may be prepared in the juice of kinihi, kiratatikta, suvaha, amalaka, haritaki and bibhitaka. Vi7#21</p>
<p>The juice of these drugs should also be administered alone or in combination with another drug or all mixed together with honey to the patient on an empty stomach in the morning.</p>
<p>Vi7#21</p>
<p>The following powder should be be given to the patient:</p>
<p>fresh horse dung</p>
<p>Spread the above over a big mat to dry up in the sun.</p>
<p>Then fine powder is made by pounding in a mortar and again grinding on stone slab.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>decoction of- vidanga or triphala</p>
<p>The powdered horse dung should be dipped well [soaked] in the above decoction, and again dried well in the sun.</p>
<p>This process is repeated 8 or 10 times.</p>
<p>Finally, grinding it on stone slab fine powder is made and stored in a new jar in a protected place.</p>
<p>Use: take in dose of 10gm, or whatever is appropriate, mixed with.</p>
<p>Vi7#22</p>
<p>The following powder/ oil may be given. This entails an interesting heat-extraction procedure:</p>
<p>One kalasa (10.24kg)- stony fruits of bhallataka</p>
<p>Crush the above and keep in a strong jar smeared inside with ghee having many fine holes in the bottom and wrapped all over with clay (and dried).</p>
<p>This jar having been covered with a lid is put on another strong and ghee-smeared</p>
<p>jar which is buried under ground up to it&#x27;s neck.</p>
<p>Now it should be covered with cow-dung from all sides and ignited.</p>
<p>When it is observed that the cow dungs are well-burnt and the stony fruits of bhallataka are freed from oil, the (upper) jar is taken out.</p>
<p>Now from the lower jar the oil is collected.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>double quantity powder of- vidanga seeds</p>
<p>Mix the above oil and powder together. They should be dried up in the sun for the whole day.</p>
<p>Use: A dose of it is administered to the patient by which he is purged well. The after-management should be as said above.</p>
<p>Then, at appropriate time, unctuous enema should be given.</p>
<p>[** This method of extracting Bhallataka oil by fire; the editor observed this procedure used for extracting oil of coconut shells at the Gujarat Ayurveda University. The only difference in their procedure was that the upper jar containing the shells to be extracted had a normal solid bottom. But it&#x27;s top was covered with a filter-cloth which was tied with twine around the mouth of the jar. The jar was then placed upside-down over the jar below it, and the junction between them was [wrapped with cloth strips and then] further sealed with clay slip. Add this description to the text, with credit to Gujarat A.U. and also include a simple diagram with the 2 layouts.]</p>
<p>Vi7#23-24</p>
<p>By the same method, following instructions for the above powder/ oil formula, the oil obtained from the wood of devadaru and sarala may be administered.</p>
<p>Vi7#23-24</p>
<p>The following oil should be used:</p>
<p>new [not aged] sesame seeds (these should be of best quality and harvested in the autumn)</p>
<p>Winnow and clean the seeds.</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>lukewarm decoction of- vidanga</p>
<p>Immerse the seeds in the decoction &quot;till the noxious material comes out&quot;.</p>
<p>Then again cleaning them well, they should be dipped in the decoction of vidanga and dried in the sun.</p>
<p>The process should be repeated 21 times.</p>
<p>Thereafter pound the seeds in a mortar and again grinding finely on a stone slab.</p>
<p>Place the resulting paste in a tub and sprinkle fresh vidanga decoction over it again and again, while pressing it with hands.</p>
<p>During this process, whatever oil comes out should be collected by hands.</p>
<p>This oil should be kept in a clean and strong jar which should be stored in a protected place.</p>
<p>Note: the patient is asked to collect new sesame seeds and bring them to the doctor.</p>
<p>Vi7#25</p>
<p>The following oil may be used:</p>
<p>[The following contains a good general description of preparing a medicated oil by cooking; -signs of when it is ready. Duplicate this to section on general preparation of formulas- preparation of oils.]</p>
<p>2 boluses of 40gm weight of the finely made paste of tilwaka and uddalaka with the decoction of vidanga</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>2 similar boluses in half quantity (20gm) of the finely made paste of syama and trivrta with the decoction of vidanga</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>2 boluses in further half quantity (10gm) of the finely made paste of danti and dravanti with the decoction of vidanga</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>2 boluses in further half quantity (5gm)of the finely made paste of cavya and citraka with the decoction of vidanga</p>
<ul>
<li class=""></li>
</ul>
<p>1.28L- vidanga decoction</p>
<p>640ml- vidangataila</p>
<p>Mix all the above together well.</p>
<p>Then put it in a big vessel which should be put over fire. A person sitting comfortably on a seat and keeping eye constantly on the oil from all sides should cook it on mild fire while stirring with a ladle constantly. When one observes that sound is stopped [[bubbling from released water vapor]], foam is subsided, oil is clarified [easy to see through], proper smell, color and taste appear, the drug-paste when pressed with the fingers is made into a wick [it sticks together and can be rolled into balls or pencil shape], does not adhere to the fingers and is not too soft or too hard. This is the time for bringing down the vessel [taking off the fire].</p>
<p>After the vessel is brought down and cooled, the content should be filtered through undamaged cloth.</p>
<p>It should be kept in a clean and strong jar closed with lid and covered with a piece of white cloth and tied well with threads and stored in a protective place.</p>
<p>Use: Appropriate dose of this should be administered to the patient by which he gets purged well.</p>
<p>After proper elimination of the noxious material he should be managed as said before.</p>
<p>Then at appropriate time, unctuous enema should be administered to him.</p>
<p>Thus he becomes free from the disorders.</p>
<p>Note: the patient is asked to bring the above required boluses to the doctor/ pharmacist to make the formula.</p>
<p>Vi7#26</p>
<p>The following oils may be prepared in the same way as the above formula:</p>
<p>By the same method one should prepare oils of sarsapa, atasi, karanja and kosataki and administer to the patient considering all the aspects.</p>

<p>Of course, one should be particularly cautious in avoiding the respective etiological factors that cause infestation by parasites.</p>
<p>Vi7#27</p>
<p>The remedy of the parasites is firstly their extraction, then destruction of their favorable environment [in the body], and finally avoidance of etiological factors Vi7#28-30</p>
<p>Thus 20 types of parasites along with their cause etc. have been described. Vi7#31</p>
