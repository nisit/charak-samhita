 Treatment General treatment Treatment by location of V Diet General topical treatment Uncting formulas
<!-- Page 9 -->

## On Vata:

"V is life, strength and sustainer of all creatures. V is the entire world, it is the master of all."

The person whose V is with unimpeded movements and in normal state lives long for 100 years devoid of disorders. -Ci28#3-4

## V is of 5 types:

[Each V sub-type is distinguished by location and action/ vector, function.]

 [ They each have their own portion of the body in which it is located, direction of movement, and functions.]

Prana, Udana, samana, vyana and apana.

V coordinates the body well while moving unimpededly in different places. Ci28#5

| Sub-type: | Locations in the body:                                                                                                                   | Functions:                                                                           |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Prana     | head, chest, throat, tongue, mouth,<br />nose                                                                                              | spitting, sneezing, belching, respiration,<br />digestion, etc.                        |
| udana     | navel, chest, throat                                                                                                                     | speech, effort, energy, strength,<br />complexion etc.                                 |
| samana    | channels carrying sweat, dosas and<br />water (fluid) and seated beside the<br />digestive fire provides strength to<br />Agni.                |                                                                                      |
| vyana     | being quick-moving pervades the<br />entire body and performs the functions<br />of movements, extension, contraction,<br />like blinking etc. |                                                                                      |
| apana     | testicles, urinary bladder and penis,<br />navel, thighs, groins, anus.                                                                    | "It releases semen, urine, feces, menses<br />and fetus while situated in intestines." |

Ci28#5-10
<!-- Page 10 -->

## About the Sub-doshas:

 They all in equilibrium and located in their places perform their normal functions by which the body is sustained free from disorders.

 If they move on wrong path or are unbalanced they afflict the body with disorders relating to their location and functions and take away life shortly.

Ci28#11-12

# Causes of Aggravation of V:

 rough, cold, little and light food, excessive coitus and vigils, faulty therapeutic management, excessive elimination of impurity and blood, excessive movements such as leaping, jumping, wayfaring and physical exercise, wasting of dhatus, excessive emaciation due to anxiety, grief and illness, uncomfortable bed and seat/chair, anger, day-sleep, fear, suppression of urges, amadosa, injury, fasting, injury in vital parts, falling down from elephants, horses and other fast vehicles.

Ci28#15-17

## The result of V aggravation due to the above:

 V, filling up the vacant channels in the body produces various disorders pertaining to the entire body or one of the parts.

Ci28#18

#### Purvarupa:

the unmanifested symptoms of these disorders; prodromal signs and symptoms

 When the same are manifested they represent the own entity of disorders while their lightness (lessened severity) denotes the subsidence of the disorder.

Ci28#19

### Symptoms produced by vitiated V:

 contractures, stiffness in joints, tearing in bones and joints, horripilation, delirium, stiffness in hands, back and head, limping, crippledness, humpedness, drying of organs, sleeplessness, destruction of fetus, sperms and ovum, pulsation, numbness in organs, crookedness of head, nose, eyes, clavicular region and neck, tearing, piercing pain, distress, convulsion, mental confusion, exhaustion.

Ci28#20-23

#### Why V produces peculiar disorders:

Due to difference of cause and location.

Ci28#24

Ci28#25-37

# Ardita (Facial Paralisys):

## Cause:

 When V aggravated severely affects one half of the body, it dries up the blood, hand, leg and knee and produces contracture in that half.

# Ci28#38

### Signs:

 Face and also nose, eyebrows, forehead, eyes and jaws get crooked. Thus the morsel of food goes in the mouth in crooked way, the nose is crooked, eyes stiffened and sneezing is suppressed in spite of impulse. Tongue when raised becomes curved, voice becomes feeble and impeded, teeth become loose, hearing is deficient ad voice is
<!-- Page 12 -->

hoarse. There is pain in foot, hand, eye, shank, thigh, temple, ear and cheek. This disease is localized either in one-half of the body or in half of the face. Ci28#38-42

## Manyastambha (stiffness of carotid regions):

occurs when V gets lodged in both the carotid regions and reaches inside.

Ci28#43

# Antarayama (emprosthotonus):

 neck bends inwards and carotid regions also get stiffened excessively. Also, there is gnashing of teeth, salivation, inward bending of back, stiffness of head, yawning and lockjaw.

Ci28#44

## Bahirayama (Opisthotonus):

Cause:

 The aggravated V drying up the external vessels situated in back, and carotid regions cause "dhanustambha" (archlike stiffness) known as "bahirayama".

Ci28#45-46

## Signs:

The body of the patient is bent downwards like bow, head goes to back, chest gets thrown upwards, carotid region gets stiffened and neck is bent downwards. There is also gnashing of teeth, yawning, salivation, and loss of speech when it comes with force it kills the patient or produces restlessness.

Ci28#47-48

# Hanugraha (lock-jaw):

 when V is located at the root of the jaw, it causes the jaws to slip down from their bonds and consequent opening of mouth or by stiffening the jaws it causes closing of the mouth.

It is characterized by stiffness and absence of pain. - Ci28#49

# Aksepaka:

 Vitiated V causes frequent convulsions in the body while drying up hand and feet along with blood vessels, ligaments and tendons.

Ci28#50

#### Dandaka (plenosthotonus):

 When V stiffens hands, feet, head, back and hip the body becomes stiff like a stick.

This is incurable.

Ci28#51

#### Progress and Prognoses in these cases:

 In ardita etc. when the paroxysm of the disorder goes away, the patient feels normal but in case if persists it afflicts him with respective troublesome symptoms.

The physician should not take up these cases.

Ci28#52

If V affects half the body and while drying up the blood vessels and ligaments it
<!-- Page 13 -->

paralyses one side, either left or right, and causes loss of movement, pain and loss of speech.

Ci28#53

Ekanga Roga:

 when vitiated V causes contracture in one of the feet or hands with piercing pain and distress.

Ci28#54

Sarvanga Roga:

when affection is generalized.

Ci28#55

Grdhrasi (sciatica):

 starts from hip and gradually comes down to waist, back, thigh, knee, shank and foot and affects these parts with stiffness, distress and piercing pain and also frequent quiverings.

 These symptoms are of V but when the disorder is caused by V and K it is associated with drowsiness, heaviness and anorexia.

Ci28#56

Khalli:

produces cramps in foot, shank, thigh and wrist.

Ci28#57

The remaining disorders may be known from the symptoms according to location and name.

## The 2 Causes of Vitiation of V: \*\*\*\*\*!!!\*\*\*\*\*

Vitiation of V takes place due to either

- 1) wasting of Dhatus or
- 2) obstruction in Srotas

Ci28#58-59

V mixed with K and P:

In all these disorders, association of P etc. should be observed.

 V, P, and K move in all the channels of the body. Due to subtleness, V itself provokes the other 2 doshas. When aggravated it excites them and carrying them to different places produces different disorders due to obstruction in passage and dries up rasa etc. (the dhatus).

Ci28#58, 60
<!-- Page 14 -->

Ci28#61-71

## Prognosis in Vatavyadhi:

 The following are curable with difficulty or incurable due to deepness of their location:

 They should be treated if they are new, free from complications and in strong patients:

 Displacement of joints, lock-jaw, contracture, humpedness, hemiplegia, wasting of body parts, paraplegia, khudavatata, stiffness and the disorders located in majja and asthi.

Ci28#72-74

## Treatment of Disorders of Vata:

## In the case that V is alone and uncovered:

- 1)It should be managed with intake of ghee, muscle-fat, oil and marrow.
- 2)When the patient is tired of uncting substance he should be given some interval and thereafter again uncted with milk, vegetable, soup of domestic, aquatic or marshy meat mixed with uncting substance, payasa (rice cooked with milk), krsara [kitchari] with sours and salt, unctuous enema, snuffing and saturating food and when uncted well should be fomented [[after each day's dose].
- 3)The patient having been massaged well should be subjected to unctuous fomentation by means of tube, bed and bolus or the means according to need.
- -After massage and fomentation even a crooked or stiffened limb can be bent gradually as desired like a piece of dry wood.
- 4)After fomentation horripilation, piercing pain, distress, dilatation [what is the definition of this word?], \*\*swelling, stiffness, \*\*seizures etc. are pacified quickly and softening comes forth.\*\*\*
- 5)The use of uncting substance nourishes the dried body tissues quickly and promotes strength, digestive power, corpulence and vital breath.
- 6)One should administer unction and sudation frequently. When the bowels are softened with unction, the disorders of V do not stay further.

Ci28#75-82

In the case that V is accompanied by excess impurity:

 1)In case, due to excess of impurity, the disorder does not get pacified, the patient should be evacuated with mild unctuous purgatives.
<!-- Page 16 -->

- 2)The patient should take ghrta prepared with tilvaka or satala or castor oil with milk- this eliminates impurity and is wholesome.
- 3)Excrement accumulated due to food being fatty, sour, salty, hot etc. checks V by creating obstruction in channels, hence one should carminate V.
- 4)If the patient is weak and unfit for purgation, he should be managed with nonunctuous enema and digestive or appetizer drugs and food mixed with them.
- 5)After evacuation and kindling of digestive fire, unction and fomentation should be administered again.
- 6)Frequent use of sweet, sour, and salty diet, snuffing and smoking should be made in all such cases.

Ci28#172-174

## General oil ingredients/ general oil notes:

Use the following ingredients to alleviate V disorders:

 decoctions of- barley, jujube, horse gram, fishes, sigru, bilva, juice of radish,

 + curd, milk Ci28#175

The following alleviates V:

 Oil + juice of- garlic + the above drugs Ci28#176

These oils may be administered [by what rout?] to women having bathed after periods. Taking one of these even a sterile woman delivers a son.

Ci28#177

The Agurvadya Taila mentioned under "cold fever" if cooked several hundred times alleviates V disorders.

Ci28#179
<!-- Page 28 -->

Also, the oils mentioned under Vatarakta for pacification of V should be used by those who desire success.

Ci28#180

There is no remedy for V disorders better than oil [not ghee, but OIL] due to presence of Vyavayi, usna, guru and snigdha [hot, heavy and oily/ slimy] properties.

Ci28#181

\*\*"Oil becomes more effective after processing."\*

\*\*\* Hence having cooked with the drugs of V-alleviating groups 100 or 1000 times it destroys the disorders located even in minute channels quickly.

Ci28#182

*Much information from this chapter has already been entered into book I. The following section has been put into "Treatment of Covering of Doshas, Dhatus and Malas" chart, under Treatment section in Book I.* 

*Here a page of information was entered under chart "Treatment of Blocked Sub-Vatas and Doshas" on last page of assessment section before Treatment section in Book I.* 

 *The following information should be appended to the information before/after this chart:* 

 Prana covers udana etc. and the latter also covers prana. Similarly all others udana etc. cover mutually. Thus there are 20 types of mutual covering of the 5 types of V in stage of aggravation. These should be observed properly.

Ci28#199-200

 As general observation, in the state of covering there occurs diminution or aggravation in normal function of these types of V.

 Thus the 8 types of covering have been mentioned above broadly with symptoms and treatment for adding to the knowledge of the wise.

Ci28#215-216

 The physician should also diagnose the other 12 types of covering of V looking to their location and increase or decrease in functions. Accordingly he should decide the line of treatment and apply massage, intake of uncting substance, enema etc. or hot and cold measures alternately.

Ci28#217-218

 ...All of them (the Vata sub-types) if not diagnosed properly, continue for a year and neglected or managed improperly become incurable.

 Due to neglect of covered Vatas, cardiac disorders, abscess, spleen enlargement, gulma and diarrhea appear as complications. Hence the physician should identify the covering of the 5 types of V by V, P or K and then prescribe the proper remedy for the same.

Ci28#235-237

 As in Universe the movement of air, sun and moon is difficult to be known so is that of V, P and K in the body.

Ci28#246

 Physician knowing diminution, aggravation, equilibrium and covering of V etc. does not get confused in therapeutic action.

Ci28#247

# Sleep Disorders

## Physiology of sleep:

 When the mind is exhausted and the exhausted sense organs detract from their objects, the man sleeps.

Su21#35

### Importance of Sleep:

 Dependent on sleep are happiness and misery, corpulence and leanness, strength and weakness, potency and impotency, intellect and non-intellect, life and death. Sleep observed untimely, excessively and negatively takes away happiness and life like the other death-night. Sleep, if properly observed, provides happiness and life like the flashed true knowledge [what is this referring to?] providing to a yogin.

Su21#36-38

#### Indications for "Sleep Therapy":

 \*\* Those who are emaciated on account of singing, reading, drinking, sexual intercourse, evacuative therapy, weight-carrying and travelling on foot, having indigestion, are injured, wasted, old, children and women; suffering from thirst, diarrhea, colic pain, dyspnea and hiccup; are lean, fallen, wounded and insane, exhausted by journey and vigils and also by anger, grief and fear and are accustomed to day-sleep **should observe it in all times**. [They should sleep day and night, as a therapeutic measure.] Thus they are endowed with equilibrium of dhatus and strength, K nourishes their body parts and their life-span becomes stable. \*

 \* In the summer season, because of roughness due to adana, aggravation of V and shortness of nights, day-sleep is recommended.

Su21#39-43

#### Contra-indications for Day-sleep:

 By day-sleep in seasons other than summer, K and P are vitiated, hence day-sleep is not indicated in those seasons.

 The obese, those having regular fatty diet, plenty of K, K-type disorders and **suffering from latent poisons** should never sleep during the day.

Su21#44-45

## Disorders Caused by Inappropriate Day-sleep:

 Halimaka (chlorosis), headache, cold sensation, heaviness in body parts, bodyache, loss of appetite and digestion, plastering of heart, edema, anorexia, nausea, rhinitis, migraine, urticarial patches, pustules, boils, itching, drowsiness, cough, disorders of throat, derangement of memory and intelligence, obstruction of channels, fever, incapability of sense organs, intensity in effect of poisons– these occur by indulgence in unwholesome day-sleep.

 Hence, the wise, after knowing the wholesomeness and unwholesomeness of sleep, should sleep happily.
<!-- Page 30 -->

## Su21#44-49

 \*\* Night vigil [staying awake at night] is rough while day-sleep [sleeping in the daytime] is unctuous.

Sitting is non-rough while movement is non-blocking.

 [In other words, sitting still/ being inactive is unctuous and being active is rough or channel-clearing.]

Su21#50

- \* As wholesome diet is needed for maintenance of body, so is the sleep.
- \* Obesity and leanness are particularly caused by sleep and diet.

Su21#51

## Therapies to Induce Sleep:

 Massage, anointing, bath, meat-soup of domestic, marshy and aquatic animals, rice with curd, milk, fat, wine, mental ease, pleasant smell and sound, gentle rubbing, **saturating drops and paste on eyes, head and face**, well-covered bed, comfortable room and **proper time** [including establishing the same time each night]– these bring shortly the sleep which is disturbed by some factor.

Su21#52-54

# Therapies to Reduce Sleep:

 Purgation, evacuation of head, emesis, fear, anxiety, anger, smoking, exercise, blood-letting, fasting, uncomfortable bed, predominance of sattwa and subduing tamas– these check the unwholesome and excessive occurrence of sleep.

#### Causes of Insomnia:

 These very factors used to reduce sleep, above, may be taken as causes of insomnia, along with (over-)work, time (old age), disorder (V-type/ vatika), constitution (V-type) and aggravation of V itself.

Su21#55-57

## Types of Sleep:

 Sleep is of the following types– caused by tamas, caused by K, caused by physical exertion, caused by mental exertion, adventitious,

 as a sequelae [[precursor/ prodromal symptom; look up definition of this word] to a disease,

 normally occurring in the night. Su21#58

 The normally occurring sleep in night is that which is regarded as supporting of creatures by the experts. That caused by tamas is known as the root of sin while the remaining ones observed in diseases. Su21#59

## Panduroga (Anemia) and Kamala (Jaundice)

## Diagnosis

 Etiology Pathology Symptoms Doshic types Type caused by eating earth Kamala (jaundice)

 Treatment General treatment Formulas- Ghees, Deocctions, Boluses, Linctuses Treatment of Earth-eating type Treatment of Bile Obstruction Signs and Treatment of "Halimaka"
<!-- Page 32 -->

(Including 5 types of pandu, 2 types of kamala, [one of which is gall-stone attack], their prognosis, their variations and the other great disease called halimaka [I'm not sure of the Allopathic name for this one].)

# 5 types of Panduroga, according to causative factors:

V, P, K, Sannipata, and due to earth-eating.

Ci16#3

## Overview of etiology/ Pathology/ Symptoms:

 The person in whom dosas with predominance of P are vitiated in dhatus is affected with laxity of dhatus and heaviness in body. Complexion, strength, unctuousness and other properties also get too much diminished due to morbidity of dosa and dusya. Thus he gets affected with deficiency of blood, fat, ojas, looseness of bodyparts and abnormality of complexion.

Ci16#7-8

## Etiology -and Pathology:

 By intake of alkaline, sour, salty, too hot, incompatible and unsuitable food, excessive use of nispava, black gram, oil cake, tila and oil, day-sleep, exercise and sexual intercourse during burning (indigestion) of food, faulty management of evacuative measures and seasons; suppression of natural urges particularly in persons inflicted with sexual desire, anxiety, fear, anger and grief P situated in heart is aggravated and propelled by the strong V in 10 arteries which spread it in the whole body. This P located in the space between twak and mamsa affects K, V, rakta, twak and mamsa and thereby produces various shades of colors like pale yellow, deep yellow and green in skin. This is called Panduroga.

Ci16#9-11

## Premonitory Symptoms:

palpitation of heart, roughness, absence of sweat and exhaustion.

Ci16#12

### Symptoms of the disease when manifested:

 the patient suffers from tinnitus, loss of digestion, debility, malaise, aversion to food, exhaustion, giddiness, pain in body, fever, dyspnoea, heaviness and anorexia. He feels as if his limbs are kneaded, pressed or churned. Moreover, he has swelling on orbit, green complexion, falling of skin hairs, loss of lustre, irritability, aversion to cold, oversleep, spitting, diminished speech, on exertion by climbing (stairs etc.) he suffers from cramps in shanks, pain in waist, thighs, and legs and lassitude.

Ci16#13-16

### Specific Characters:

### Vata Type:

V vitiated by V-aggravating diet and other regimens produces blackish paleness, roughness and reddishness in body, body-ache, pain, piercing pain, trembling, pain in sides and head, dryness of stool, distaste in mouth, oedema, hardness in bowels and debility.

Ci16#17-18

### Pitta type:

P vitiated by its aggravating factors particularly in a person of P
<!-- Page 33 -->

constitution affects rakta etc. and thus causes panduroga. The patient becomes yellow or with greenish tinge, associated with fever, burning sensation, vomiting, fainting, thirst and yellow urine and stool. He perspires profusely, has desire for cold and aversion to food. He has pungency in mouth, hot and sour things do not suit him. He suffers from acid eructations and burning sensation during burning of food [[digestion]] along with foul odour, loose motions, debility and feeling of darkness. - Ci16#19-22

# Kapha Type:

 K aggravated by the K-aggravating factors causes panduroga as said above. Thereby it produces heaviness, drowsiness, vomiting, whitish complexion, excessive salivation, horripilation, malaise, fainting, giddiness, exhaustion, dyspnoea, cough, lassitude, anorexia, obstruction in speech and voice, white urine, eyes and stool, desire for pungent, rough and hot things, oedema and sweetness in mouth. - Ci16#23- 25

## Sannipataja Type:

 In those who use all sorts of things, all dosas get vitiated and cause tridosic panduroga exhibiting symptoms of all the 3 doshas. This type is very troublesome. - Ci16#26

# Earth-eating Type:

 In the person habitually eating earth one of the dosas gets vitiated (according to the type of earth) such as V, P, and K by astringent, alkaline and sweet earth respectively. The earth, moreover, produces roughness in dhatus. It fills up and obstructs the channels without undergoing change and thus by destroying the strength of senses, lustre, energy and ojas produces panduroga which further destroys strength, complexion and power of digestion. The patient suffers from swelling on cheek, orbit, and eyebrows, feet, navel and private parts, intestinal parasites and diarrhoea passing stool with blood and mucus. - Ci16#27-30

## Prognosis:

#### The following conditions are Uncurable:

 Panduroga of a long duration having produced excessive roughness is not curable.

 The patient developing swelling after a long duration and having vision of objects as yellow is not treatable.

 The patient who passes scabulous, scanty stool wit5h mucus and green colour, has anxious expression, white and excessively smeared limbs, suffers from vomiting, fainting and thirst and if he becomes white due to deficiency of blood is incurable. - Ci16#31-33

## Etiology, Pathology, and Symptoms of Kamala (Jaundice):

 The patient of panduroga who takes P-aggravating things excessively, his P burns blood and flesh and thus gives rise to the disorder. His eyes, skin, nails and face become deep yellow, feces and urine as red and yellow and he looks like a frog. His senses and organs lose their functions and he is associated with burning sensation, indigestion, debility, malaise and anorexia.

 It is due to aggravation of P and is known as located in kostha (belly) or sakha (blood etc.).

Kumbhakamala (jaundice located in belly) being established firmly due to
<!-- Page 34 -->

chronicity becomes curable with difficulty.

Ci16#34-36

## Prognosis of Kamala:

 The patient of jaundice succumbs soon to the disease if feces and urine becomes black yellow, there are excessive swelling, blood in eyes, mouth, vomiting, "feces and urine" (what?), fainting, burning sensation, anorexia, thirst, hardness in bowels, drowsiness, confusion, loss of the power of digestion and consciousness.

## Treatment of Pandu Due to Earth-eating:

There are 2 steps:

- 1) elimination of the ingested earth by administration of strong evacuative (according to the patient's strength)
- 2) when the body has been cleansed of the earth, administration of strength-promoting ghritas Ci16#117-118

Ghrita to use for earth-eating pandu:

equal quantity- trikatu, bilwa, garidra, daruharidra, triphala, 2 types of punarnava, musta, lauha bhasma, patha, vidanga, devadaru, vrscikali, bhargi, yavaksara

+

ghee

Cook the above together.

Ci16#119

Ghrita to use for earth-eating pandu:
<!-- Page 45 -->

nagakesara, madhuyasti, pippali, yavaksara, durva

+

ghee

Cook the above together.

Ci16#120

Treatment of patient who refuses to stop eating earth:

 If the patient does not desist from earth-eating due to greediness, the earth should be given to him amply impregnated with drugs which destroy it's harmful effect such as:

 vidanga, ela, ativisa, nimba leavea, patha, brhati (fruits), katurohini, indrayava or murva.

Ci16#121-122

## [Gall-Stone] or other bile-duct obstruction:

 The patient who passes white stools like sesamum-paste indicates the obstruction to the passage of bile due to K.

This should be relieved by eliminating K.

Etiology:

 Due to intake of rough, cold, heavy and sweet food, exertion and suppression of the natural urges

Pathology:

 V vitiated and powerful and mixed with aggravated K throws P out of it's own seat

Symptoms:

 thus making the person with yellow eyes, urine and skin and white stools associated with gurgling sound and stillness of abdomen and heaviness in cardiac region. Due to diminution of P because of it's sifting to blood circulation patient suffers gradually from debility, poor digestion, pain in sides, hiccup, dyspnea, anorexia and fever.

Ci16#124-127

## Treatment of Obstructed Bile Passage/ G.B.:

Diet:

Cereals with rough, sour and pungent meat soups of peacock, partridge
<!-- Page 46 -->

and cock or soup of dried radish and horse gram.

One should use juice of matulunga added with honey, pippali, marica and sunthi.

Thus P returns to it's seat.

Ci16#128-129

## General Treatment:

 The management of the case with pungent, sharp, hot, salty and excessively sour substances should continue till bile pigments appear in stool and V is pacified.

Ci16#130

## Management once the Bile Passage has been cleared:

 When P has reverted to it's place, stool is pigmented with bile (recovered it's normal yellowish colour) and the complications are subsided then the case should be managed following instructions for regular jaundice listed in this chapter.

Ci16#131

## Signs and Treatment of Halimaka:

Signs:

 When the patient of pandu develops green, blackish and yellow complexion associated with loss of strength and energy, drowsiness, poor digestion, mild fever, loss of desire for women, body-ache, dyspnea, thirst, anorexia and giddiness it is known as Halimaka.

Ci16#132-133

Cause:

It is due to vitiation of V and P.

Ci16#133

Treatment:

1)the patient should be properly uncted

2)he should be purged

3)he should use mostly sweet substances alleviating P and V.

## Notes on Purgative formulas to use in Halimaka:

1) Buffalow's ghee

Juice of- Guducci

Milk

Process the above together.

Or 2) trivrta

Juice of- amalaka

Ci16#134-135

Notes on the P and V treatment/ formulas to use in Halimaka:

He should also use regularly draksaleha listed earlier [in this chapter?].
<!-- Page 47 -->

He should use sweet ghrtas, sustaining milk enemas along with unctuous enemas.

In order to improve digestion, he should take arista and mardika (both are grape fermentations)

He should also use according to dosha and strength abhayaleha (described in Kasa chapter) (Agastyaharitaki), pippali, madhuka, and bala with milk. Ci16#134-137

## Treatment of Disorders of the 3 Vital Parts

 There are 107 vital parts [These later get used for 'marma chikitsa'] in the body located in the trunk and extremities. -Si9#3

 In case of affliction in any of them there is excruciating pain because of the specific attachment of consciousness to them. Si9#3

 Of them those located in the trunk are more important than those located in the extremities because the latter are dependent on the former. Si9#3

 Of them also the hrt (heart), basti (urinary bladder) and siras (head) are important ones because they are roots of the body.

Si9#3

 In the heart, 10 dhamanis (vessels), prana and apana, mind, intellect, consciousness and mahabhutas are established as spokes in the hub.

Si9#4

 In the head, senses, channels carrying them [nerves] and vital breath are located as rays in the sun [as sun-rays emanate from the sun].

Si9#4

 Basti situated in the middle of rectum, scrotum, 'raphe' [?], vas deferens and ureters is receptacle of urine and stabilizer of all the fluid-carrying channels, just as the sea is the receptacle of all the rivers.

Si9#4

 By numerous channels known as vital parts rooted to the above the body is pervaded like the sky by the sun rays.

Si9#5

 By breaking of any of the above 3 the body is broken quickly because by destruction of substratum the dependent is also destroyed.

Si9#5

By their affliction, there is appearance of severe disorders.

 Hence these should be protected particularly from external injury as well as the doshas (internal factors).

Si9#5

Symptoms When the heart is afflicted:

 cough, dyspnea, debility, dryness of throat, traction of kloma, protraction of tongue, dryness of mouth and throat, epilepsy, insanity, delirium, vacantness of mind. Si9#6

Symptoms When the Head is Afflicted:

 stiffness of carotid regions, facial paralysis, rolling of eye balls, mental confusion, cramps, loss of movement, cough, dyspnea, lock-jaw, muteness, stammering, 'ptosis', quivering of cheeks, yawning, salivation, loss of voice, crooked-ness of face etc.
<!-- Page 54 -->

Si9#6

Symptoms When Basti if Afflicted:

 retention of flatus, urine and feces; pain in groin, penis and urinary bladder, kundala, udavarta, gulma, vatasthila, upastambha (stiffness), spasm in navel, lower abdomen, anus and hip.

Si9#6

Symptoms along with treatment of these affected with the dosas have already been said in the section on therapeutics. (Ch. 2).

Si9#6

However, these should be protected particularly from V.

V is the cause of aggravation of P and K and is also the root cause of vital breath.

That again is most amenable to enema therapy.

Hence there is no other therapy equal to enema for protecting the vital parts.

 So in order to protect the great vital parts one should administer the 6 groups of (drugs used in ) unctuous enema as said in Vimanasthana and the formulations of enema mentioned here and other remedies applicable in V disorders after considering carefully.

Si9#7

## Treatment of Heart:

If the heart is affected by V, one should prescribe the powdered asafoetida added with powder of one of the salts to be taken with juice of matulunga or the palatable sour liquid.

Si9#8

 The patient should be advised to take the decoction of laghu pancamula added with sugar as drink and gruel cooked with the decoction of 'rhat' [Brhat] pancamula.

Si9#8

Besides, measures prescribed for heart disease should be adopted.

Si9#8

Treatment of Head:

 If head is affected by V, massage, sudation, poultices, intake of uncting substance, snuffing, juice pressing, smoking etc. are recommended.

Si9#8

## Treatment of Bladder:

 If urinary bladder is affected by V, pitcher fomentation, suppositorie, nonunctuous enema of one of the following are recommended:

- 1) non-unctuous enema of syamadi drugs processed with cow's urine
- 2) non-unctuous enema of bilvadi drugs processed with urine
- 3) non-unctuous enema of milk boiled with roots of sara, kasa, iksu, darbha and goksuraaka added with paste of the seeds of trapusa, ervaru and kharasva, barley,
<!-- Page 55 -->

rsabhaka and vrddhi:

 Unctuous enema with oil cooked with daruharidra and tilvaka ghrta for purgation are recommended. [All the above enemas do purgation.]

 [These are good non-unctuous enema formulas to keep in mind generally.] Si9#8

The following formula alleviates Pain in the Bladder and Other Urinary Disorders:

 Oil processed with 4 times decoction of the roots of satavari, goksura, brhati, kantakari, guduci, punarnava, usira, madhuka, both types of sariva, lodhra, sreyasi (rasna), kusa and kasa as well as milk along with the paste of bala, vasa, rsabhaka, seeds of kharasva, upakuncika, kutaja, trapusa and ervaru; sitiavakaka, madhuka, vaca, satapuspa, pasanabheda, varsabhu and madanaphala used as urethral douche or nonunctuous enema in a person evacuated, uncted and fomented alleviates pain in bladder and other urinary disorders.

Si9#8

Protection of the 3 Vital Organs:

The Vital Breath of men resides in the heart, head and urinary bladder.

Hence one should make every effort to protect them.

Si9#9

 The protection of vital parts consists of avoidance of impending factors, observance of the code of conduct for the healthy and remedy of disorders if arisen.

Si9#10

 Hereafter will be described some of the disorders of the vital parts which are not said in the chapter on treatment of the same (Ci. 26) along with their remedy:

Si9#11

Symptoms of 'Apatantraka':

 V vitiated by it's own aggravating factors moves upwards from it's place reaching the heart and then head and temples, afflicts them and bends the body like a bow, causes convulsions and mental confusion.

 The patient breathes with difficulty, has stiff and closed eyes, loses consciousness and groans like a pigeon.

This is known as 'Apatantraka'.

Si9#12-13

Symptoms of 'Apatanaka':

Causing fixed vision and unconsciousness it makes the patients groan.

 When the heart is freed he become normal and again gets unconsciousness when it is covered.

This severe condition caused by V is said by some as apatanaka.

Si914-15

 One should cleanse the channels obstructed by K and V with irritant blowings thus when the obstructions are removed, the patient regains consciousness.

Si9#16

 One should also use the fine powder of marica, seeds of sigru, vidanga and phanijjhaka as head-evacuation. - Si9#17
<!-- Page 56 -->

(The powder of) tumburu, haritaki, hingu, puskaramula, 3 salts should be taken with water boiled with barley in affliction of heart and apatantraka.

Si9#18

 Hingu, amlavetasa, sunthi, sauvarcala and pomegranate should be taken. Si9#19

 Besides, other measures alleviating V and K and heart disease are beneficial. Si9#19

 The drastic evacuative enema are not wholesome for the patient wholly. Hence ghrta cooked with sauvarcala, haritake and trikatu should be given. Si9#20

 When due to regular intake of sweet, unctuous and heavy food, mental work, physical exertion, anxiety and chronic illness K impelled by V overpowers the heart and obstructs intellect etc. located there, stupor arises.

 Restlessness in heart, heaviness in speech, movements and senses and unpleasantness in mind and intellect– these are the features of stupor. -#21-23

 This should be managed with K-alleviating evacuation, pacificatory measures, physical exercise, blood-letting and diet consisting of pungents and bitters.

Si9#24

 Mutraukasada, mutrajathara, mutrakrcchra, mutrotsanga, mutrasamksaya, mutratita, vatasthila, vatabasti, usnavata, vatakundalika, granthi, vidghata and bastikundala— these are 13 disorders of urine.

 Now listen about their symptoms: Si9#25-26

## The 13 Disorders of Urine:

Si9#(27-) 32-43

 When P is associated there are: burning sensation, pain and abnormal colors in the urine.

Si9#44

 When K is associated there is: heaviness, swelling and urine as unctuous, precipitant and white.

Si9#45

Prognosis: The condition of urinary bladder with obstruction of it's duct by K

and aggravation of P is incurable.

Si9#46

The condition where the duct is not obstructed and coiling is

absent is curable.

Si9#47

 In conditions of coiling of urinary bladder thirst; fainting and dyspnea arise.' Si9#48

 Looking to the predominance of doshas, these should be treated with diuretics. Si9#49

 Enema and urethral douche should be given in all of these cases. Si9#49

## Urethral Enema:

Specifications for Uretheral Enema Equipment:

The catheter of the urethral douche should be made of: gold or silver.

 It should be smooth, of diameter equal to that of jasmine or oleander flower, tapering like cow's tale, with hole fitting to the mustard seed, having 2 ears and 12 fingers in length.

This should be fitted to goat's urinary bladder.

Si9#50-51

Administration of Urethral Enema:

 With this the uncting substance in the dose of 20gm or so according to age should be introduced.

 This should be applied to a person having taken a bath and food with meat soup or milk, having passed the urges of feces and urine and seated comfortably and straight on a soft, knee-high seat.
<!-- Page 59 -->

His penis should be made erect and a probe smeared with ghee is inserted to see of the passage is unobstructed.

 Then the catheter of the size of penis should be introduced into urethra parallel to the 'perineal raphe' like (enema nozzle) in anus.

 If over-inserted it may injure the urinary bladder and on the other hand if underinserted the uncting substance may not reach there.

Thus pressing easily without shaking the catheter should be taken out.

 After it comes back, the second and third one should be given (in like manner). If it does not come back it should be ignored till night is passed.

Si9#52-57

 Pippali, salt, soot, apamarga, mustard, juice of vartaka, nirgundi, aragvadha and sahacara pounded with cow's urine and sour liquid along with jaggery are made into a suppository which are should be inserted into the urethra. [!]

 This suppository should be the size of the mustard on the tip and of black gram in the latter half; it's length should be equal to that of the catheter, it should be smeared with ghee, should be soft but unbreakable.

\*\* For urethra it should be like catheter but for anus it should be size of thumb.

Si9#58-60 [the above line is a general rule. Spell out.]

 When the uncting substance comes back, the management, restrictions, complications and signs of proper application are like those in unctuous enema.

Si9#61

Administration for Women During Menstruation:

 "This remedial measure should be applied in case of women during the period of menstruation because at that time the uterus is devoid of covering and as such receives the unction easily thus V having been overcome conception in uterus takes place quickly.

 Besides, vaginal douche processed with respective drugs should be given in disorders of urinary bladder, prolapse of uterus, severe pain in genital track, disorders of genital track, menorrhagia, retention or incontinence of urine."

Si9#62-64

Urethral Enema for Women:

Administration of Urethral Enema for Women:

 In case of women, the catheter should be 10 fingers long, with circumference like that of urethral canal in which the grain of green gram may pass on.

In genital track, it should be inserted up to 4 fingers,

while in urethra upto 2 fingers

and 1 finger in female child

It should be inserted parallel to the vertebral column.

 [The catheter itself should be 10 fingers long, for ease of reach and use, but is never inserted more than 4 fingers (vagina) or 2 fingers (urethra).]

Si9#65-66

Administration of Urethral Enema for Women:

 The catheter should be inserted easily while she is lying in supine position, flexing her legs fully.

 Thus the unction should be given through douche twice, thrice or 4 times in 24 hours.
<!-- Page 60 -->

After the douche is given, suppository somewhat thicker should be inserted. In this way, the treatment should be continued for 3 days gradually increasing the dose of uncting substance.

 This should be repeated after 3 days in the same manner. Si9#67-69

## Hereafter some types of the disorder of head will be described:

 Rakta, P and V when vitiated are spread to the temple region and cause severe swelling with intense pain, burning sensation and redness.

 This having intensity like that of poison blocks the head and throat quickly and kills the patient within 3 days.

This is named as 'sankhaka'.

 If the patient survives after 3 days the treatment consisting of head-evacuation, sprinkling etc. and other anti-erysipelas measures should be given after declaring the incurability of the disease.

Si9#70-73

 V vitiated due to intake of rough food, over-eating, eating during indigestion, exposure to easterly wind and dews, excessive coitus, suppression of urges, exertion and physical exercise singly or accompanied by K seizes the half of the head and then produces severe pain like cutting and churning in half of the carotid region, eyebrow, temple, ear, eye and forehead.

This is 'ardhavabhedaka'.

If it is far advanced, it may destroy sight and hearing.

Si9#74-76

 In this condition, maximum dose of 4 fats, head evacuation, purgation, tubular fomentation, old ghee, enema, unctuous enema, upanaha (poultice), cranial pouch and cauterization are commended along with other measures prescribed in coryza and cranial disorders.

Si9#77-78

 Due to suppression of urge, indigestion etc. blood and V get vitiated and then affect the brain which thus affected is gradually liquefied after sunrise due to heat of the sun-rays and headache increases as the day advances and gets subsided at the end of the day when the brain matter is solidified. This is 'suryavarta'.

Si9#79-80
<!-- Page 61 -->

In this condition, intake of ghee after meals, head-evacuation, purgation, application of 3 fats on head, poultice (on head) with meat of wild animals and sprinkling with ghee and milk should be applied.

 Moreover, ghee extracted from the milk boiled with peacock, partridge, common quail, etc. and processed with the (paste of) vitalizer drugs and 8 times milk should be given as snuff.

Si9#81-83

 Due to indulgence in fasting, grief, rough, cold and little food, the 3 dosas get vitiated and cause intense pain in carotid regions and back neck which stays in eyebrows and temples.

 It also causes twitching near the cheeks, eye diseases and lock jaw. This is 'anantavata'.

Si9#84-85

 This should be treated with venesection and other measures prescribed in Suryavarta.

Si9#86

V vitiated by the use of rough etc. causes trembling of the head.

 This should be treated with the uncting substance processed with guduci, gala, rasna, mahasveta and asvagandha, unction and sudation and saturation snuffing. - Si9#87

## Disorders of the 3 Vital Organs:

## The 3 vital organs are:

 basti ("kidney"[/bladder?]) hrdaya (heart) siras (head) Ci26#3

## Importance of the 3 vital organs:

 Of the 107 vital parts mentioned under enumeration of body components, these 3 are regarded as important ones by the experts because they are seat of vital breath.

If the doshas effect these 3, they will also effect the vital breath.
<!-- Page 62 -->

Hence in order to protect them listen about the management of great disorders in them O gentle one!

Ci26#3-4

Etiology, Symptoms and Consequences of Udavarta (upward movement of V): If apana V in colon gets vitiated due to intake of astringent, bitter, pungent and rough food; suppression of urges, fasting and coitus, it creates obstruction in lower passages because of strength and causes retention of feces, flatus and urine and finally severe udavarta (upward movement of V).

 Because of this there starts intense and frequent pain in pelvis, cardiac region, sides and front of abdomen, back and sides of chest.

 Besides, due to obstruction in apana V, there are tympanitis, nausea, cutting pain, piercing pain, indigestion, cystitis, retention of stool, enlargement of mesenteric glands and upward movement of V; stool is passed with difficulty, as dry and with delay, body becomes coarse, rough and cold [and] consequently disorders such as fever, dysuria, dysentery, cardiac disorders, grahani disorder, vomiting, blindness, deafness, headache, vatodara, vatasthila, mental disorders, thirst, internal hemorrhage, anorexia, gulma, cough, dyspnea, coryza, facial paralysis and chest pain arise.

Many other severe V disorders are caused by Udavarta.

Ci26#5-10

## Treatment of Udavarta:

 The patient should be massaged with oil prepared with drugs alleviating cold fever and then fomented (as mentioned in that chapter) till the impurity is dissolved.
<!-- Page 63 -->

When the impurity is dissolved, the patient should be managed with suppositories, non-unctuous and unctuous enema, purgatives and carminative diet.

Types of dysuria:

8

Ci26#27

## Causes of dysuria:

excessive physical exertion, intake of irritant drugs, rough food and wine, riding on a fast-moving vehicle, overeating meat of marshy animals and fish and indigestion.

Ci26#27

Pathology of dysuria:

 doshas vitiate separately or all together get located in kidney or urinary bladder and press upon the urinary passage.

Ci26#28

General Signs of dysuria:

The person urinates with difficulty.

Ci26#28

Signs of V dysuria:

 there is severe pain in groins, pelvis and penis and the patient passes urine scanty and frequently.

Ci26#29

Signs of P dysuria:

 the patient passes yellow or bloody urine with pain and burning sensation frequently and with difficulty.

Ci26#29

Signs of K dysuria:

 there are heaviness and swelling in urinary bladder and penis and the urine is slimy.

Ci26#29

Signs of sannipata dysuria:

all the above symptoms are found.

It is the most difficult type of dysuria.

Ci26#30
<!-- Page 67 -->

## Asmari (Calculus):

When V dries up semen or urine, P or K, the calculus arises gradually like gall stone in cow.

## Calculus:

 When the calculus simulating kadamba flower, stiny, smooth, prismatic or soft comes in the passage of urine, it obstructs the flow of urine and thus causes pain in bladder.

 Urine is passed in divided streams and with pain in suture [ureters], penis and bladder.

 The patient, with agonizing pain, presses the penis and sometimes passes stool and sometimes urine.

 If the passage or bladder is injured by irritation of calculus urine is passed with blood (hematuria).

When calculus shifts from the passage, the patient passes urine with ease.

Ci26#32-33

Sarkara (gravels):

 When the calculus is disintegrated by V and comes out of the urinary passage it is known as Sarkara (gravels).

Ci26#34

Blocked discharge of Semen:

 Discharge of semen checked by dosas separately situated in urinary bladder produce pain in penis and pelvis, difficult passing of urine mixed with semen.

 The patient's pelvis as well as testicles get stiffened, swollen and intensely painful.

Ci26#35

[Cystic Hemolith]:

 Due to cut or injury or loss (of semen) blood discharged within the urinary bladder is bound up and causing agonizing pain is converted into a calculus after combining with urine.

 When it is accumulated too much there are inflation and heaviness in urinary bladder which is relieved after the calculus passes out.

Ci26#36-37
<!-- Page 68 -->

## In V dysuria:

 massage, unctuous and non-unctuous enema, unctuous poultice, urethral douche and affusion [?] as well as the diet of meat prepared with sthiradi (laghu pancmula) and other V-alleviating drugs.

Ci26#38

 The patients of calculus and dysuria should avoid physical exercise, suppression of urges, dry, rough and floury food, exposure to wind, sun and sexual intercourse, kharjura, lotus root, kapittha, jambu, lotus stem and astringents.

 Properties of internal fire, how it holds up the body, how the food is digested, the functions of food and how they are performed, types of agnis and the entities nourished and digested by them, successive origin of dhatus etc. and malas, the reason in quick action of aphrodisiacs, time taken in and order of the origin of dhatus, the reason in manifestation of disorder in a part of body, causes of the severe affections of agni and the resultant disorders, description of grahani, and the characters of its disorder, symptomatic treatment, excessive agni and its treatment- all this has been said by the sage in this chapter on grahani disorder.

[#244-249 ]

# The significance of Agni (digestive fire):

 Life-span, complexion, strength, health, enthusiasm, corpulence, lustre, immunity, energy, heat processes and vital breath- all these depend on body fire.

 One dies if this fire is extinguished, lives long free from disorders if it is functioning properly, gets ill if it is deranged, hence Agni is the root cause of all.

Ci15#3-4

 Food can only nourish the dhatus, ojas, strength, complexion etc. by the help of Agni because these things (the dhatus, etc.) can't be produced by undigested food.

Ci15#5

## Picture of Sub-Vatas and Agni involved in initial digestion of food:

 Prana Vayu (which has receiving function) carries the food to the belly where the food gets disintegrated by fluids (juices) and softened by fatty substances, then gets acted upon by the digestive fire fanned by Samana V.

 Thus the digestive fire cooks the timely taken and balanced food properly, leading to promotion of lifespan.

 Agni cooks from below the food situated in the stomach for division into rasa (nutritive factor) and mala (excretion) as the same cooks the rice grains with water kept in a vessel into boiled rice.

Ci15#6-8

#### Stages the food goes through as it is digested:

 The food composed of 6 rasas immediately after it is ingested undergoes the stages of "prapaka" (preliminary digestion).

Firstly, due to predominance of sweetness K (mucus secretion) of frothy character arises.

 Thereafter during the process of digestion when the food is half-burnt and descending from the stomach due to predominance of acidity P (the bile and other digestive factors) comes forth freely.

 Lastly when it reaches the large intestines, it is absorbed by fire and gets converted into a solid mass, V (wind) is formed due to predominance of pungency.

Ci15#9-11

#### Food and the 5 senses:

 The desired food endowed with desired smell etc. nourishes the factors of smell [sense substrata] etc. as well as the olfactory sense [sense organs] etc. individually in the body.

Ci15#12
<!-- Page 116 -->

#### Digestion of the individual 5 elements within food:

 5 Agnis pertaining each to prthivi, ap, tejas, vayu, and akasa digest the respective fractions of the food ([food is nothing more than varying combinations of the 5 elements]).

Ci15#13

### Each of the 5 elements in the food nourishes respective similar body tissues:

 "In body, the substances and their properties nourish their counterparts respectively such as the fraction of prthvi in food nourishes the respective fractions in the body and so on."

 [So, in other words, the water element in a soup will go to nourish the watery rasa dhatu, while the fire element from the spices in the soup will go to nourish the fiery rakta dhatu.]

Ci15#14

# As the dhatus (tissues) are further refined, they undergo further transformation into *excretion* and *essence*:

 "Further (during the process of metabolism) the dhatus supporting the body undergo twofold conversion into excretion and essence having been acted upon by the respective one of the seven agnis."

 [Each of the 7 dhatus has it's own agni responsible for this above-mentioned process, relating to it's own dhatu.]

Ci15#15

## Progressive order of transformation of Dhatus:

[Each dhatu nourishes the next dhatu in a linear process.]

 "The formation of dhatus takes place in the following order- Rasa, Rakta, Mamsa, Medas, Asthi, Majja and Sukra. Sukra, from it's pure essence, produces fetus."

Ci15#16

#### Nourishment of the "Upadhatus":

 [Upadhatus are other body tissues. Each of the 7 Dhatus has a couple Upadhatus which are said to be produced by it.]

 "Food also nourishes the upadhatus in the following manner- Rasa nourishes breast-milk as well as menstrual blood in women.

Rakta nourishes tendons and blood vessels

Mamsa nourishes vasa as well as 6 layers of skin

Medas nourishes the ligaments and joints."

Ci15#17

#### Excretions of the G.I. tract and Dhatus:

[Each Dhatu that has an Upadhatu also has a Mala or waste.]

"Excretion of food is feces and urine.
<!-- Page 117 -->

Excretion of rasa is kapha (phlegm).

Excretion of rakta is pitta (bile)

Excretion of mamsa is dirt of the external orifices

Excretion of medas is sweat

Excretion of asthi is hairs in head and body

Excretion of majja is smear in eyes, feces and skin

 Thus the fractions of essence and excretion formed during the process of metabolism support each other and thus maintain the body by mutual coordination."

Ci15#18

## Time periods for conversion of Dhatus:

 "The specific potency of the intake of aphrodisiacs etc. exerts it's effects quickly. Some take this process of conversion competed in a period of 6 days. The gradual conversion of dhatus runs incessantly in a cyclic order."

Ci15#20-21

## Explanation of How Each Dhatu is Converted into the next Dhatu:

 ""...the disciple submitted thus- "How is rakta originated in the body from dissimilar rasa which does not have red colour, and how does it acquire redness? How does the solid flesh (mamsa) originate from the liquid blood (rakta)? How is the origin of medas (fat) from the liquid blood and solid flesh? How is there hardness in bones which are originated from the soft tissues muscle and fat? How does the unctuous and soft marrow arise within the hard bones? Sukra is said to be the product of majja but how does the semen pervading the entire body come out of the marrow situated inside the bone when there are no holes in the bone?""

 ""The teacher having been requested thus by the disciple answered as follows: "Rasa, the essence of food, acquires redness from the colour of the firelike P.

 The same acted upon by vayu, ap and tejas and cooked by it's own heat and being predominated by it's own heat, ap and unctuous properties is converted into medas.

 Further the innate heat combining prthivi, tejas, vayu, etc. together gives rise to hardness and thus produces asthi.

 Within the bones vayu creates hollowness which is filled up by the marrow, the essence of medas.

From the essence of marrow, semen is produced.

 By vayu, akasa etc. porousness is produced in bones through which semen comes out like water from the new earthen jar. Semen moves through it's carrying vessels in the whole body and propelled with force from sexual ecstasy and passionate determination gets displaced and liquefied like ghee by physical exertion comes out of the urinary passage like water flowing towards the lower surface (?)."" Ci15#22-35

## Omnipresence of rasa dhatu:

 "Rasa (including rakta) is always, everywhere, continuously and simultaneously thrown (into circulation) in the body by the vyana V performing the function of throwing."
<!-- Page 118 -->

#### Ci15#36

#### How blocked rasa causes disorders:

 "Rasa while in circulation if sticks somewhere due to morbidity in channel, it causes disorder there like a cloud in the sky causing rain below it.

 Dosas also get aggravated in localized parts in the same way." Ci15#37

### Preeminence of the Jathar agni among all the agnis in the body:

 The agni which digests food ["Jathar" agni, in the stomach/small intestine] is regarded as the master of all agnis because increase and decrease of other agnis depend on the digestive fire.

 Hence one should maintain it carefully by taking properly the wholesome fuel of food and drinks because on it's maintenance depends the maintenance of life-span and strength.

 One who eats greedily leaving aside all the rules acquires the disorders due to morbidity in grahani soon."

Ci15#38-41

# Section on Description of Disorders of Grahani:

# The 3 Wrong Eating Habits:

These 3 cause death or severe disorders:

Samasana: eating wholesome and unwholesome food items mixed together.

Visamasana: eating more or less than the proper amount to eat, or before or after the proper time to eat.

Adhyasana: eating while the previous meal is still undigested.

Ci15#235-237 [perhaps provide examples for the above.]

### Difference in over-eating at the Day meal versus the Night meal:

 Even on indigestion of the day meal [lunch] the night meal [supper] is not disturbing.

 [In other words, even eating too much during lunch will not prevent digestion of supper.]

 The reason is that during the day the heart is blossomed like a lotus [open] and because of this all channels remain clear.

 Moreover, due to physical exertion, movements and mental activities the dhatus do not get moistened during the day.

 So on other food added to the unmoistened previous one does not get effected and becomes homogeneous like fresh milk mixed with un-spoiled milk.

 On the contrary, during the night the heart is faded, the channels are covered and the belly is obstructed and consequently the dhatus get moistened.

 Another food added while the undigested material is moistened gets affected like hot milk added to spoiled milk.
<!-- Page 119 -->

Hence the wise person in order to protect his strength and life-span should never eat anything if the food taken in night is still undigested. [This goes for late-night snack as well as breakfast or even lunch the next day.]

Ci15#238-243

# Causes of Deranged Agni:

 fasting, eating during indigestion, over-eating, irregular eating, intake of unsuitable, heavy, cold, too rough and contaminated food, faulty administration of emesis, purgation and unction, emaciation due to some disease, faulty adaptation to place, time and seasons and suppression of natural urges.

 Agni thus deranged becomes unable to digest even the light food and the food being undigested gets acidified and toxic.

Ci15#42-44

### Symptoms and Consequences of "that indigestion":

 stasis of food, malaise, headache, fainting, giddiness, stiffness in back and waist, yawning, bodyache, thirst, fever, vomiting, griping, anorexia and improper digestion of food.

 The severe food toxin when combined with P produces burning sensation, thirst, disorder of mouth, acid gastritis and other P disorders.

 When combined with K it gives rise to phthisis, coryza, prameha etc. and other K disorders.

It produces various V disorders if combined with V.

 Affecting urine, feces and dhatus it causes disorders of urine, belly and dhatus respectively.

Ci15#45-49

#### Result of Irregular digestive fire:

causes disequilibrium in dhatus because of irregular digestion of nutrients.

### Result of Intense digestive fire:

(if the person has little fuel [food]) dries up the dhatus.

Ci15#50

#### Result of Normal digestive fire:

 in a person taking proper food maintains the equilibrium of dhatus by regular digestion.]

Ci15#50

## Result of Weak digestive fire:
<!-- Page 120 -->

burns the food incompletely which goes either upwards or downwards.

 When it [the incompletely-digested food] moves out downwards either in ripe [digested] or unripe [undigested] condition, it is known as the disorder of grahani.

 In such patients often the entire food is half burnt and the stool is frequent, constipated or liquid.

 There is presence of thirst, anorexia, abnormal taste in mouth, excessive salivation and feeling of darkness.

 Besides, edema on feet and hands, pain in bony joints, vomiting and fever are there.

Eructations have metallic or fleshy odor and bitter sour taste.

Ci15#51-54

Prodromal symptoms are the following ones:

thirst, lassitude, debility, burning of food, delayed digestion and heaviness

Ci15#55

in body.

## Cause and Symptoms of Excessive Agni:

 In the person having diminished K, the aggravated P following the V strengthens the fire in its seat (grahani) by it's intrinsic heat.

 Then fire getting intensely powerful along with V in the person excessively roughened digests the food forcibly, quickly and frequently due to intensity.

 After digesting the food, it also digests [(breaks down)] the dhatus resulting in debility, disorders and finally death of the person.

 The patient afflicted by excessive fire gets relief from food but becomes restless soon after it is digested.

 Thirst, dyspnea, burning, fainting etc. are the disorders due to excessive fire. Ci15#217-220

## Location and function of Grahani:

 Grahani is the seat of Agni and is called so ["graha"] because of holding up the food.

 It is situated above the umbilicus [belly button?] and is strengthened by the power of Agni.

 Normally, it holds up the food (till it is digested) and releases it from the side after it is digested but when it is deranged due to weak digestive fire it releases the ingested material even in unripe condition.

Ci15#56-57

## Types of Grahani [Roga]:

## Etiology of V type Grahani:

 When V is vitiated due to intake of pungent, bitter, astringent, too rough and cold food articles, little or no food, too much travelling on foot, suppression of urges, sexual intercourse, envelops the agni and thus makes it sluggish.

 Because of this food is digested with difficulty and hyperacidity associated with coarseness in body, dryness in throat and mouth, hunger, thirst, blurred vision, tinnitus,
<!-- Page 121 -->

frequent pain in sides, thighs, groins and neck, visucika (piercing pain in abdomen), cardiac pain, emaciation, debility, abnormal taste in mouth, cutting pain in abdomen, greed for every food item, lassitude, tympanitis during and after digestion subsiding after taking meal, suspicion of vatagulma, heart disease or splenomegaly arise.

 The patient passes stool as liquid, dried, thin, undigested, with sound and frothy frequently and with difficulty after a long time.

He also suffers from cough and dyspnea.

v#58-63

## Etiology of P type Grahani:

 By intake of pungent, uncooked, burning, sour, alkaline food etc. P gets aggravated and extinguishes the fire by flooding over like hot water.

 Thus the patient having yellowish lustre passes frequently undigested bluish or yellowish liquid stool associated with fetid and sour eructations, burning in cardiac region and throat, anorexia and thirst.

Ci15#64-66

## Etiology of K type Grahani:

 K aggravated by intake of food which is heavy, too unctuous, cold etc., overeating, and sleeping just after meals extinguishes the fire.

 Then effected person digests the food with difficulty and is inflicted with nausea, vomiting, anorexia, sliminess and sweetness in mouth, cough, spitting and coryza.

 He fools his heart as stretched, abdomen as still and heavy and has foul, sweet eructations, malaise and lack of desire for women.

He passes stool as broken mixed with ama and mucus and heavy.

Though not emaciated he has debility and lassitude.

Ci15#67-70

## Etiology of Tri-Doshic type of Grahani:

 When etiology and symptoms of V etc. described separately above join together, the condition is said as caused by 3 doshas.

Ci15#71

## Imbalanced Agni is classified under the Grahani disorder:

 The 4 types of agnis ((listed in the chapter of classification of diseases (Su. 9) )) except the one normal agni type also comes under the grahani disorder.

Ci15#72
<!-- Page 122 -->

## Treatment of Grahani:

## General Treatment in Grahani:

1) When the morbidity is situated in grahani and is flared up with the "half-burnt" [half-digested] food and if one observes it as associated with the symptoms of ama such as distension, salivation, discomfort, burning, anorexia and heaviness:

It should be eliminated by administering:

warm water or

decoction of madanaphala or

[decoction of] pippali and sarsapa.

[Note: add "Symptoms of Ama in Grahani" from above to Diagnosis

## Chptr.]

- 2) Even if the ama is hidden or situated in pakvasaya: it should be discharged by adminstering purgations mixed with appetisers.
- 3) If rasa associated with ama has circulated the whole body" lightening and digestive measures should be adopted.
- 4) When the stomach is cleaned: the patient should be given light diet like liquid gruel etc. followed by appetizing formulations.
- 5) When the ama is known as digested fully in the grahani disorder caused by V: the physician should prescribe ghee mixed with appetizers. [In order to kindle Agnni.]
- 6) When agni is stimulated slightly but there is retention of stool, urine and flatus: the patient should be uncted for 2 or 3 days, fomented and massaged and then subjected to non-unctuous enema. [Note: Here is the 1st sentence/place I have seen the charaka mention 'uncing' (internal oleation) and massage (using oil formulas externally). So, indeed, they are different entities to Punarvasu. \{This has relevance to 'Oleation' chptr., and to Pancha karma sequence.}.]
- 7) Thus when V is pacified and the impurity is loosened: the patient should be purged with: castor oil [mixed with alkali] or tilwaka ghrta mixed with alkali.
- 8) When the patient is free from impurity, has rough viscera and is constipated, unctuous enema with oil [OIL, not ghee, marrow, etc.] prepared with appetizers, sours and V-alleviating drugs should be administered to him in proper dose.
- 9) After administering A) non-unctuous enema, B) purgative and C) unctuous enema and D) giving light diet thereafter, the patient should be advised to E) take ghee regularly.
<!-- Page 123 -->

## General treatment measures for those suffering from [ALL] types of grahani roga:

unction

sudation

evacuation

lightening

appetising

powders

salts

alkalis

madhu [which is what? Honey?]

arista, sura, asava

various formulations of buttermilk

appetizing ghees - Ci15#196-197

## \*\*Diet recommended for Grahani:

Pancakola soup (soup of cereal added with pancakola)

Radish soup added with black pepper

Spiced meat soup of wild animals added with fat and sour pomegranates and

butter

Meat soup of carnivorous animals mixed with appetisers

## \*\*Post-meal drink:

Buttermilk [yogurt: water = 1:4 or 1:10 parts]

Sour gruel

Wine

Arista.

These should be taken as post-meal drink.

Ci15#115-116

## \*Benefits of Buttermilk for Grahani:

 Buttermilk is efficacious in grahani disorder due to appetising nature, astringency and lightness.

 Because of sweet vipaka, it does not vitiate P, is wholesome in K and due to astringent, hot, vikassi (depressant) and rough properties and in V due to sweet, sour and viscous nature (thus it is useful in all 3 doshas).

Buttermilk, if fresh [not fermented?], does not produce burning (or acidity).

 Hence the use of buttermilk prescribed earlier in abdominal disorders and piles are all applicable in grahani disorder and should be applied in all ways.

Ci15#117-119
<!-- Page 124 -->

## Appetizers

Symptomatic Treatment in Grahani Roga by use of appetizers to stimulate Agni:

## In K predominance:

Spitting, rough and appetizers along with bitters.

Ci15#198

## In patient emaciated having plenty of K:

 Both rough and unctuous substances should be given one after the other And the appetizers should also be given mixed with unctuous substances considering first the condition of ama in his body.

Ci15#199

## \* In excess of P:

Bitters along with sweet substances.

#200

### In excess of V:

 "It" [bitters? *Appetizers(*?)] should be given along with unctuous substance, salt and sours.

Ci15#200

# Use of Fat/ Oil to Kindle Agni:

Sneha (fat) is excellent as a stimulant of weak fire.

Even much heavy food is not able to pacify the fire kindled by fat.

 Hence one passing undigested diarrheic stools due to deficient agni should take adequate dose of ghrta *mixed with appetising drugs*.

The Mechanism by Which Fat/ Oil Kindles Agni:

 By this the samana V being normalised and positioned in its normal passage and due to it's movement nearby improves the power of agni *quickly*.

 One who passes stool with difficulty due to hardness should take ghee in ample quantity added with salt in mid-meal.

-the above paragraphs Ci15#201-204

## If agni is deficient due to roughness:

 one should take ghee or oil mixed with appetizers. Ci15#205

## Treatment of other specific complications of Grahani Roga:

In case of deficiency of fire due to excessive unction:

 powders, aristas and asavas are wholesome. Ci15#206

#### In case of diarrhea due to coating in the ano-rectum:

oil, sura [type of wine/vinegar], and asavas are good.
<!-- Page 125 -->

#### Ci15#206

#### In case of deficient agni due to udavarta:

non-unctuous and unctuous enema are given.

Ci15#207

#### In case of deficient agni due to aggravated doshas:

 one should first be evacuated and then treated for the particular dosha which is aggravated.

Ci15#207

# Stimulation of Agni during convalescence:

 During the period of convalescence, the deficient fire should be stimulated by ghee.

Ci15#208

# In case of deficient agni due to fasting:

it should be stimulated by taking ghee with gruels.

Ci15#208

### Ghee taken in the midst of the meal is promoter of strength, appetite and body weight. Ci15#208

\* Specific Indication for Carnivorous Animal's Broth:

 In case patient is debilitated, wasted and emaciated due to chronicity of the disease:

 give light diet with soured meat soups of the animals of prey or carnivorous animals. They stimulate the agni quickly due to intense, hot and evacuating properties.

 They promote the body weight more quickly because the meat of these animals has itself been nourished by flesh. Ci15#209-210

## Treatment of Tridoshic type of Grahani Roga:

General Treatment of Tridoshic Grahani Roga:

- 1) apply the 5 evacuative measures methodically
- 2) administer ghrtas, ksaras, asavas and arista which improve agni.

Apply remedies collectively described individually under each doshic type of grahani roga.

Ci15#194-195

## Method and cause of Stimulated Agni:

The digestive fire is stimulated by neither fasting nor over-eating.

 ( For example, a fire without kindling, or covered with excessive kindling gets extinguished.)

The power of agni increases with the intake of:

unctuous food

various powders and
<!-- Page 138 -->

aristas

As fire with the fuel of heartwood is stable and lasts for long, the internal fire is stabilized by the application of unctuous food.

One enjoys health for long by taking wholesome diet in proper quantity and after the previous food is digested.

"One should be careful to promote the agni by [not] disturbing the equilibrium of the dhatus."

When the doshas are in equilibrium the heat of agni 'located in the mid-portion of the body' is also normal and the food digested by it leads to promotion of health, corpulence, life-span and strength. If agni becomes deficient or excessive due to imbalanced dosas, it causes disorders.

Ci15#211-216

## Treatment of Excessive Agni:

Administer heavy, unctuous, cold, sweet and slimy food and drinks.

(These act like pouring water on fire.)

 Even on indigestion he should be fed frequently so that agni without fuel may not get opportunity to kill him [(by breaking down the dhatus)].

 The patient should eat rice cooked in milk, rice cooked with pulse, fatty and floury preparations, products of jaggery, fatty meat of aquatic and marshy animals.

 One should eat fishes particularly smooth and moving in still water and fatty mutton which destroys the excessive fire.

While hungry he should take gruel mixed with bee's wax or drink ghee.

 Or after venesection he should take churned drink of wheat four [mantha] or milk boiled with sugar, ghee and vitalizer drugs.

 The bolus of powdered oily fruits [dates, figs, etc.] added with sugar and fatty meat soups make the fire mild.

 The patient should drink ghee mixed with bee's wax followed by cold water or wheat flour mixed with ghee followed by milk.

 Or he should take three fats (except oil) processed with the meat juice of marshy animals or solid preparations made of fine wheat flour mixed with the 3 fats with milk.

 One should take the bark of udumbara mixed with woman's breast milk or payasa (rice cooked with milk) prepared with these 2.

 The patient should be subjected to frequent purgation with milk boiled with syama and trivrt for eliminating the excess of P giving the diet of rice cooked with milk.
<!-- Page 139 -->

The wise physician considering all the aspects should administer the above measures.

 Whatever food is sweet, fatty, K-aggravating and heavy is entirely wholesome for the patient of excessive fire along with day-sleep after meal.

 The patient who without going into fainting takes fatty diet in excessive fire does not fall a prey to the possible disorders, but on the contrary, attains corpulence.

 When K is increased, P along with V is overcome, the normalized fire in one having balanced dhatus digests the food leading to promotion of corpulence, life-span and strength. Ci15#221-234

"He is capable of treating the King who knows in essence, the etiology, symptoms and prodroma of phthisis."

Ni6#17

## Mythical Origin of Yakshma:

 The following "puranic" myth full of passionate indulgence about the moon was heard by the sages from the conversing gods abiding in the heaven. The body of the moon because of excessive attachment to Rohini [a god? a food?] was reduced to loss of unctuousness and his carelessness to protection of health. Due to non-enjoyment with the other daughters Prajapati (the lord of progeny) became furious and his anger came out of his mouth in embodiment through expiration. The moon wedded the 28 daughters of the lord of progeny but did not deal with all equally. Thus despised by the great, treating his wives unequally, filled up with rajas and debility the moon was attacked by yaksma (phthisis).

 Having been overcome by the severe anger of the great, the lustreless moon went to the refuge of the great accompanied by gods and godly sages. Now, the lord of progeny, knowing the pure mind of the moon, was pleased and as such he was treated by Asvins.

 Thus, the moon, having been freed from the obstacles, and having increase of Ojas from Asvins attained particular splendor and pure psyche.

Ci8#3-10

## Names of yakshma:

 krodha, yaksma, jwara, roga- are all synonyms and known as dukha (unhappiness).

Because it first occurred to the moon, it is known as "Rajayaksma".

 "This yaksma despised with the sound "Hum" was dispatched to the humanly world by Asvins where finding the fourfold etiology it enters into the human beings."

Ci8#11-12

## There are 4 causes of phtisis:

 over-exertion suppression of the natural urges wasting irregular meals Ci8#13, Ni6#3

## Details on Excessive Exertion as Cause of Phthisis:

That over-exertion is one of the causes of phtisis will be explained further.

When a weak person fights against a strong one,

or exercises with an excessively big bow,

or speaks too much

or carries excessive weight,

or swims across a long distance in water,

or is habitually subjected to forceful anointing and kneading with feet,

or travels fast to a long distance
<!-- Page 142 -->

or is assaulted

 or when a person takes up battle, reading, weight-lifting, traveling on foot, leaping, jumping etc or falls down or has injury, or other exertive actions or actions disproportionate to strength or complicated actions

 ... his lungs/ chest is wounded due to excessive effort and V having been vitiated aggravates the other 2 doshas and runs here and there in the body. -Ni6#4, Ci8#14-16

Situated in the head, it causes headache;

in the throat, it causes irritation in throat, cough, hoarseness of voice and anorexia

in the sides, it causes pain in sides,

in the rectum, it causes diarrhea

in the joints, it causes yawning and fever

in the chest, it causes chest pain

Due to wound in chest:

 The patient on coughing expels sputum with blood (hemoptysis) from the hollow chest with difficulty experiencing severe pain in chest.

 Thus the phthisis caused by "over-reaction" [over-exertion] is associated with the above eleven symptoms.

Ci8#14-19

 Again, due to the above forms of over-exertion, V gets aggravated in the lung wound and located there it takes along K residing in lungs and also affects P and spreads upwards, downwards and obliquely.

 It's portion which enters into the body joints gives rise to yawning, body-ache and fever.

 That which goes to amasaya produces disease of lungs and anorexia; that which goes to the throat produces irritation of throat and hoarseness of voice;

that which goes into the channels carrying vital breath causes dyspena and coryza;

 that which is located in head produces distress in head, thus due to wound in lungs, irregular movement of V and irritation of throat, cough arises frequently and because of this lungs having been wounded further hemoptysis starts, and consequently the patient becomes weak.

 Thus these complications due to over-exertion afflict the person indulged in it. Further because of having been afflicted with these wasting complications, he gradually falls a prey to phtisis.

 Hence the wise should take up works considering and commensurate to his strength because the body is dependent on strength and the person basically consists of the body.

Ni6#4

 One should abstain from over-exertive action in order to protect his life because he will be able to enjoy the desired fruits of the action only if he lives. [a little humor!] Ni6#5

## Details on Suppression of the Natural Urges as Cause of Phthisis:

 When due to bashfulness, or disgust, or fear one suppresses the impelled urge of flatus, urine and feces, V, due to obstruction of the impulse propels K and P upwards,
<!-- Page 143 -->

obliquely and downwards and thus produces the disorders having symptoms of all the 3 doshas such as:

> coryza, cough, hoarseness of voice, anorexia, pain in sides, headache, fever, pain in shoulders, body-ache, frequent vomiting and diarrhea.

 These are the eleven symptoms on account of which the disease is called as great.

Ci8#20-23

 Again, that suppression of natural urges is a cause of phthisis will be explained further.

 When a person checks the impelled urges of flatus, urine and feces because of attending the king, the master or the preceptors or having joined the society of gambling and nobles in the midst of women;

or while traveling on uneven vehicle;

due to fear, environment, bashfulness or disgust,

... V gets vitiated due to suppression of urges.

Ni6#6

 This vitiated V aggravating P and K spreads upwards, downwards and obliquely. Then, as said earlier, with a portion entering into the specific body parts gives rise to pain, diarrhea or drying up of feces, excessive pain in sides (of chest), pain in shoulder, irritation in throat and lungs, headache, cough, dyspnea, fever, hoarseness of voice and

coryza;

 then having been afflicted with these wasting complications, the patient gradually becomes a victim of phthisis.

 Hence the wise should be particularly careful in observing the ways which promote and protect the body;

body is their substratum and also the base of the person. - Ni6#6

 Setting all other things aside, one should protect one's body because in it's absence there becomes complete absence of all the body entities.

Ni6#7

## Details on Wasting as Cause of Phthisis:

Phthisis due to wasting leads to loss of life.

 Excessive reducing due to envy, eagerness, fever, terror, anger and grief and excessive indulgence in sexual intercourse and fasting lead to loss of semen and ojas.

 This in turn, due to loss of unctuousness, vitiates V which further aggravates the other 2 doshas and produces these 11 symptoms such as:

> coryza, fever, cough, bodyache, headache, dyspnea, diarrhea, anorexia, pain in sides, feeble voice and distress in shoulders.

Ci8#24-27

That wasting is the cause of phthisis will be explained further.

 When a person is invaded excessively at the heart by anxiety and grief; or by envy, ambitions, fear, anger, etc; or while being emaciated uses rough food and drinks; or weak by birth is subjected to fasting or malnutrition, his rasa residing in heart gets
<!-- Page 144 -->

diminished and because of this he acquires phthisis.

 In case of want of (proper) management, he gets associated with the disease having symptoms to be described later.

Ni6#7.1

 Or when a person due to excessive passion and with excessive attachment to woman indulges in excessive sexual intercourse, his semen gets diminished because of this.

 In spite of semen being diminished, if his mind is not detracted from women, and he is further engaged in sexual act with excessively determined passion, his semen is not discharged because of it's already diminished state so due to physical exertion (during coitus) V enters into the blood vessels and causes blood discharged from them which comes out of the seminal passage, due to loss of semen, along with the symptoms of V.

 Now, due to the loss of semen and hemorrhage, his joints become loose, roughness appears, body becomes further weak and V gets vitiated.

 The vitiated V spreading in the body devoid of semen and blood and aggravating K and P dries up muscles and blood, expels K and P, causes pain in sides (of chest) and shoulders, irritation in throat, aggravating the K of head, refills it with K, causing pain in joints produces body-ache, anorexia and indigestion, due to stirring up of P and K and taking opposite course V gives rise to fever, cough, dyspnea, hoarseness of voice and coryza.

 Due to frequent cough, the lungs are injured and hemoptysis ensues, consequently the patient suffers from debility and having been afflicted with these wasting complications he gradually becomes a victim of phthisis.

 Hence the wise protecting his body should protect his semen because it is the final product of food. - Ni6#8

 Semen is the best essence of one's food, hence it should be protected because it's diminution leads to many diseases or even death.

Ni6#9

\*\*\* That irregular dieting is a cause of phthisis will be explained further.

 When a person takes usually the food– drinkable, eatable, chewable and lickable– irregularly in terms of nature, preparation, combination, quantity, place, time, rules for dietetic use and suitability, his V, P and K attain imbalance.

 \*\* These imbalanced dosas spreading in the body when they stay obstructing the openings of channels whatever food he takes is mostly transformed into urine and feces only and not so into other dhatus.

 In this stage he continues on the support of feces, hence feces should be protected particularly in case of the person suffering from phthisis and also of that who is too much lean and weak.

 In him devoid of nourishment, dosas aggravated due to irregular dieting produce respective complications and lead to further degradation.

 V causes pain, body-ache, irritation of throat, chest pain, pain in shoulders, hoarseness of voice and coryza, P causes fever, diarrhea, internal heat and K produces coryza, heaviness of head, anorexia and cough.

Due to frequent cough lungs are injured and hemoptysis ensues and consequently
<!-- Page 145 -->

debility arises.

Thus these 3 dosas aggravated by irregular dieting produce phthisis.

 Having been afflicted with these wasting complications, the patient gradually dries up.

 Hence the wise should take food which is not irregular in terms of nature, preparation, combination, quantity, place, time, rules of dietetic use and suitability.

 The wise person, heedful of the many troublesome diseases caused by irregular dieting, should eat wholesome, measured and timely food with self-restraint.

Ni6#10-11

## Details on Irregular Diet as Cause of Phthisis:

 In a person taking various foods and drinks irregularly, the doshas produces severe and difficult disorders.

 Due to irregularity the imbalanced doshas obstruct the channels of blood etc. Consequently the dhatus are not nourished and the disease is produced.

Ci8#28-29

## Prodromal Symptoms and Symptoms of All Types of Phthisis:

 By regular use of these 4 etiological factors of phthisis V, P and K get vitiated. These vitiated dosas dry up the body with various complications.

 Physicians call it Rajayaksma because it is the most troublesome among all the diseases or because in early times it afflicted the Lord Moon, the king of stars.

Ni6#12

 The following are the 11-fold manifestation of the king of diseases attended by a troop of disorders:

Caused by K:

coryza, excessive salivation, cough, vomiting and anorexia,

Caused by P:

fever, distress in shoulders and hemoptysis

Caused by V:

 pain in sides, headache, hoarseness of voice Ci8#30-32

## Prodromal symptoms of Phthisis:

coryza, frequent sneezing, excessive secretion of mucus, sweetness in mouth, aversion to food, exhaustion during meal time, finding fault with utensils, water, cereals, pulses, flour preparations, spicy preparation, and caterers which are free from fault or have a little fault;

 nausea after meals, and intermittent vomiting during meal, swelling on face and feet, frequent looking at the hands, excessive whitishness in eyes, curiosity about measurement of arms, longing for women [lust], loss of disgust, loathsome view of his body, frequent dreams of waterless watery places; deserted village, city, district and region; forests dried, burnt and destroyed; contact with, riding over or using the vehicles drawn by chameleon, peacock, monkey, parrot, serpent, crow, owl etc. or dog, camel, ass
<!-- Page 146 -->

and boar; and riding over heaps of hairs, bones, ash chaff and charcoal. Ni6#13

## Prodromal Symptoms of Phthisis:

Prodromal symptoms of the "multi-formed" phthisis are as follows:

 coryza, debility, seeing defects even in defectless things, loathsomeness in body, abhorrence, wasting of strength and flesh in spite of meals, longing for women, wine and meat; desire for veiling, often falling of flies, insects, hairs and straws in food or drink, growing of hairs and nails, striking by birds, locusts and ferocious animals, in dream climbing over the heap of hairs, bones and ashes, vision of water reservoirs, mountains, forests and stars in the state of drying, wasting and falling.

Ci8#33-37

## On Srotas, Dhatus and Malas in Pathology of Phthisis:

 "Dhatus get metabolized by their respective agni and are nourished by their respective channels." (Duplicate/ Move this note to the section on Dhatus).

 Rajayaksma takes place due to blocked channels, loss of blood etc. and decrease of dhatuagnis.

 During this period whatever food in the gastro-intestinal tract is digested by (jathara) agni is converted mostly to malas and only a little is utilized for ojas.

 Hence the stool in the patient of rajayaksma should be cared for particularly because in the state of the wasting of all the dhatus, the strength of the stool supports the body. \*\*\*\*\*

 Rasa, because of blocking of channels, accumulates in it's own place and comes out with the impulse of cough in various forms.

 Thereafter 6 or 11 disorders manifest due to congregation of which the disease is known as rajayaksma [[versus just yaksma, which needn't have all these symptoms?]]. Ci8#38-43

## [Symptoms of manifested Phthisis]:

Thereafter 11 symptoms arise such as:

fullness of head,

cough,

## The 11 Disorders/ Symptoms of Rajayaksma:

 cough, distress in shoulders, derangement of voice, fever, pain in sides, headache, hemoptysis, excretion of sputum, dyspnea, diarrhea, anorexia. - Ci8#44 The 6 Disorders/ Symptoms of Rajayaksma:
<!-- Page 147 -->

## cough, fever, pain in sides, derangement of voice, diarrhea, anorexia. Ci8#45

## Prognosis of Phthisis:

 If the patient is emaciated and weak– he is rejectable for treatment (no matter whether he is having all, half or only 3 of the symptoms)

 If the patient is strong– he should be treated (no matter if he even has all the symptoms).

Ci8#46-47

Prognosis:

 One having all the symptoms of phthisis should be regarded as curable in case his strength, muscles and blood are not wasted, he is strong and the fatal signs have not appeared.

 The strong and well-nourished, because of tolerance to intensity of disease and drugs, should be taken as having a few symptoms in spite of having plenty of them. -#15

 On the contrary, the patient who is weak and has excessively diminished strength, muscles and blood should be taken as having numerous symptoms and with fatal signs even if he has [only] a few symptoms and no fatal signs because of intolerance to the intensity of disease and drugs.

 Hence his case should be discarded because the fatal signs appear in a moment and without any apparent cause.

Ni6#16

The next sutras (up to the sutras talking about Treatment) describe some of the localized complications/symptoms of yaksma:

## Cause of Coryza (common head cold):

 In a patient with his head inflated with V, K, rakta or P situated at the root of nose rushes towards V which gives rise to severe and debilitating coryza.

Ci8#48-49

## Symptoms of Coryza:

 headache, heaviness, olfactory derangement, fever, cough, excessive sputum, hoarseness of voice, anorexia, impairment of senses. "Thereafter yaksma manifests."

The patient of yaksma while coughing spits out rasa– slimy, viscous, with fleshy
<!-- Page 148 -->

smell, green or white-yellow– following the sputum.

 Distress in shoulders and sides, burning sensation in hands and feet and generalized fever- these are the symptoms of rajayaksma.

Ci8#49-52

## Cause and Symptoms of Hoarseness of Voice [In Rajayaksma]:

Hoarseness of voice is caused by V, P, K, rakta, impulse of cough and chronic coryza.

In V type:

The voice affected by V becomes rough, feeble and unstable

In P type:

Is associated with burning in palate and throat and aversion to

speaking

In K type:

The voice becomes slow, obstructed and stertorous.

In Rakta:

The voice obstructed by rakta becomes depressed and rises with

difficulty.

In hoarseness due to excessive impulse of cough:

The voice damages the throat.

In hoarseness due to chronic coryza:

The voice has predominance and symptoms of K and V.

Ci8#53-54

Pain in sides is irregularly present and characterized by constriction and expansion.

Ci8#55

Headache in the patient of yaksma is associated with heat and heaviness.

Ci8#56

Due to irregular diet the patient of yaksma with his body debilitated spits out blood and sputum agitated and accumulated.

Ci8#57

 Rakta due to blocking of channels does not reach mamsa etc. [the solid dhatus] and situated in kaphasaya [stomach] and excited due to imbalance reaches the throat.

The chest being blocked by V and K suffers from dyspnea.

 When agni is impaired by doshas the patient passes slimy stool and suffers from diarrhea.

Ci8#58-59

 When the doshas jointly or individually are located in tongue and heart, anorexia occurs.

It (anorexia) is also psychic due to disgusting objects.

 Anorexia caused by V, P and K should be known by astringent , bitter and sweet tastes in the mouth respectively and the psychic one by finding fault with the objects (the patient complains about the food or thing which is bothering him).

Ci8#60-61

 Vomiting caused by anorexia, impulse of cough, excitement of doshas and fear may also take place as complication of other disorders. - Ci8#62 Note: ["Yaksma is wholly tridoshic. Hence the physician should examine the predominance or otherwise of each dosha in the concerned stage before treating the
<!-- Page 149 -->

# patient."] - Ci8#63

## \*\*\* Treatment of Wasting and Depletion in Phthisis:

## Use of Meat Soup for Wasting:

 The patients who are drying up and emaciated should be given well-prepared meats of carnivorous animals which are particularly bulk-promoting.

The meat of peacock should be given to the patient of phthisis and in the name of peacock methodically well-prepared meat of vultures, owls, and blue jay should be given.

 Likewise, crow should be given to the patient in the name of partridge, serpents in the name of snakefish and fried earthworms in the name of intenstines of fish.

 The physician should get meat of fox, large mongoose, cats and jackal-cubs served in the name of rabbit.

 One should give the meat of lion, bear, hyena, tiger and other similar carnivorous animals in the name of deer for increasing flesh.

 The physician should give the well-spiced meat of elephant, rhinocerous and horse in the name of buffalo for increasing flesh.

 The meat of animals nourished on meat only of animals and birds is an excellent flesh-promoting due to it's being sharp, hot and light.

 The pretext is only taken resort to in cases of undesirable meats which are not in practice because in that way they can be eaten easily.

 In case the patient comes to know the reality and is disgusted he should not eat it or vomit if already eaten.

Hence there is advice of giving these meats by way of pretext.

 The meats of peacock, partridge, cock, swan, boar, camel, ass, cow and buffalo are excellent flesh-promoting.

 In chapter on food and drinks (Su, 27), the 8-fold source of meats has been described.

 From these the physician should select and give the suitable meat to the patient of phthisis.

 Animals and birds which are snatchers, burrow-dwellers, living in marshy land and water, as moving in water should be given in diet in proper quantity to the patient of "vatika sosa".

 Animals and birds which are peckers, gallinaceous and live in forest should be given to the patient of phthisis having predominance of K and P.

 These meats which are to be eaten should be well-prepared by prescribed method, favorable, soft, juicy and having good aroma.

 By keeping on meat diet, drinking wine after meals and having firm and broad mind, phthisis does not stay in the body for long.

 Phthisis does not find place in a person taking the scum varuni regularly, always cleaning his body and not suppressing the natural urges. - Ci8#149-164

## \* Use of Wine in Phthisis:

 After taking meat one should drink prasanna, varuni, sidhu, arista, asava and madhu according to suitability [all types of fermented drinks].

Ci8#165
<!-- Page 160 -->

## \* Function of Wine to Open the Srotas and Allow Tissue-Bulking:

 Wine due to sharpness, non-sliminess and subtle-ness opens the mouth of channels by churning. Consequently, the 7 dhatus revive their process of nourishment (metabolism) and consequently the phthisis succumbs quickly.

Ci8#166-167

Cereals which are at least 1 year old ("old grain") should be prescribed.

 The cereals which are light, have not lost their potency, are palatable, fragrant and exhilirating are the most wholesome ones.

 Whatever dietary regimen is prescribed in Ksata-Ksina (Ci.11) should be applied in phthisis in order to improve the patient's strength and flesh. - Ci8#182-184

 By massage, anointing, un-torn and favorite dress, bath, dipping and washing according to season, enema, use of milk and ghee, meat, rice with meat soup, favorite wines, use of charming perfumes, look of friends and beautiful ladies, instrumental and vocal music, pleasant and cheered up mood, constant company of the elders, celibacy, thrift, austerity, worship of gods, truthfulness, good conduct, wholesome behavior, nonviolence, worship of physicians and brahmanas, the king of diseases goes away.

<!-- Page 178 -->

Fever is the chief among diseases because of afflicting the body, senses and mind and is the oldest of all diseases and is severe.

[[Ci3#3]]

 'First of all, I will describe, in the order of beginning with etiology, the earliest 8 diseases arisen from greed, malice and anger, along with the principles of therapeutics in brief. Later on in the section on therapeutics I will describe the 'later developed disorders'."

Ni1#15

 Amongst the diseases, fever is described first because of it's being the earliest (in appearance) of the somatic diseases.

Ni1#16

## These words are synonyms of "nidan" [general cause]:

 hetu, nimitta, ayatana, kartta, karana, pratyaya and samutthana [These are etiological factors of any disease, not just fever.]

## The 3 types of Nidan [cause of disease]:

 unsuitable conjunction of sense organs with their sense objects, intellectual error and consequence (of the 1st two above).

Ni1#3

[consider duplicating/ moving the above 2 lines to diagnosis chptr.]

 Fever always arises at time of origin and destruction [birth and death]. Ci3#4-10

## Synonyms of Jwara:

 vikara, roga, vyadhi, atanka Ci11#11

## The Source of Origin of Fever:

 The (deranged) doshas of body and mind. (Fever does not arise in the person devoid of deranged doshas.) Ci11#12

 Again, by nature fever is related to the god of death and is known as ksaya (wasting), tamas (causing loss of consciousness), papma (sinful) and mrtyu (causing death) because it leads the person suffering from their own deeds to fiveness (death when only five mahabhutas remain bereft of consciousness).

Thus is said the prakrti (original source as well as nature of fever.

Ci11#13

 Initial appearance of fever is due to parigraha (receiving) and Rudra's wrath which is already mentioned in the section of diagnosis. (Ch.I).

Ci11#14
<!-- Page 179 -->

Insert here/ to somewhere in this chptr: Vi3#39-40 (On trtmnt of fever with hot water)

## [Mythical] Origin of Fever:

 In the second age (treta yuga) when Lord Siva was observing the vow of wrathlessness (penance), the demons living on obstacles to penance, created mischief for thousand divine years in order to put obstacles in the penance of the great soul. Daksa Prajapati (Lord of Progeny) though capable ignored even seeing all this. Moreover, he did not give due place to the offerings to Lord Siva in the sacrifice (organized by him) in spite of having been advised by the gods to do so. Thus he made the sacrifice devoid of the mantras relating to the Lord of animals and offerings pertaining to Lord Siva which were necessary for the success of the sacrifice. When after completion of the vow, the god Rudra came to know the lackings of Daksa, he, the knower of the self, came into the wrathful state and by creating a (third) eye in his forehead the potent one, reduced all these demons to ashes and created a boy, heated with the fire of anger, who could destroy the celebrations of the sacrifice. After this the sacrifice was destroyed, the gods were pained and the living beings afflicted with heat and pain were moving here and there in all directions. Then the congregation of gods along with the seven sages praised the omnipresent Lord with incantations till Lord Siva returned to his normal benevolent state. Knowing that he is now in the benevolent mood the fire of wrath, which due to fear holds the weapon of ashes, possesses 3 heads, 9 eyes, is disturbed with burning flames, fierce and gradually has short legs and belly, submitted to the Lord with folded hands– Now, sir! What should I do for you? The Lord replied to him– 'You will be fever in the world during the birth and death and also in conditions of unwholesomeness.'

Ci11#15-25

## Effects of Fever:

 pyrexia, anorexia, thirst, bodyache, distress in cardiac region It is the great darkness during birth and death.

"Thus original source (including nature), initiation and effect (of fever) are said." Ci11#26

## The 8 Causes of Fever:

are described as follows... [now included into this chapter from Nidanasthana] Ci11#27

## Etiology of V-type Fever: General Vitiation of V:

over-use of rough, light, cold substances

 excessive administration of emesis, purgation, non-unctuous enema and head evacuation,
<!-- Page 180 -->

physical exercise, suppression of natural urges, fasting injury, sexual intercourse, excitement, anxiety, excessive blood-letting, vigils uneven postures of the body Ni1#19

## Pathology of V-type Fever:

 When this vitiated V enters into the amasaya [stomach] and gets mixed up with heat, accompanying the initial dhatu produced by digestion of food and known as 'rasa', blocking the channels carrying rasa and sweda (sweat) and affecting the agni takes out the heat from the seat of digestion and spreads it all over the body, thus producing fever. Ni1#20

## Symptoms of V-type Fever:

 irregular onset and remission irregular temperature unstable mildness and severity of fever emergence or aggravation of fever at the end of digestion (of food), day, night and summer

 particular roughness and reddishness in nails, eyes, face, urine, stool and skin excessive tearing of nails, etc. [as above] various types of localized or shifting pains in different organs such as:

 numbness of the feet, cramps in calf

 laxity in knee joint or all the joints lassitude in thighs

breaking pains in the waist

aching pains in the sides

pressing pains in the back

churning pains in the shoulder

cracking pains in the arms

extracting pains in the scapular region

constricting pains in the chest

loss of function in jaws

tinitus

piercing pain in the temples

astringent taste or loss of taste in mouth

dryness of mouth, palate and throat

thirst

cardiac pain

dry vomiting
<!-- Page 181 -->

dry cough checking of sneezing and eructation aversion to food and tastes salivation anorexia indigestion malaise yawning, bending, trembling' exhaustion giddiness delirium insomnia horripilation sensation in the teeth liking for hot things

unsuitability of the factors mentioned under etiology

Etiology of P-type Fever:

Ni1#21

 excessive use of hot, sour, salty, alkaline, pungent food taking meals during indigestion, exposure to the intense sun and fire exhaustion, anger, irregular meals Ni1#22

suitability of things which are opposite to those listed under etiology

## Pathology of P-type Fever:

 The vitiated P when getting into the contact with heat in amasaya, accompanying the initial dhatu formed by digestion of food and known as rasa, blocking the channels carrying rasa and sweda, impairs agni due to liquidity and taking out the heat from the seat of digestion and spreads it all over the body with pain, it produces fever.

Ni1#23

## Symptoms of P-type Fever:

 onset or aggravation of fever simultaneously in the whole body particularly during the mid-digestion of food, the mid-day, midnight or the autumn (season);

pungency in the mouth

inflammation of nose, mouth, throat, lips and palate

thirst

narcosis

giddiness,

fainting

vomiting of bile

diarrhea

dislike for food

malaise

sorrow

delirium

appearance of red patches in the body

greenishness or yellowishness in nails, eyes, mouth, urine, stool and skin
<!-- Page 182 -->

hyperpyrexia, intense burning sensation liking for cold 'unsuitability of the contrary ones' Ni1#24

## Etiology of 'Slesma jwara' (K-type Fever):

 excessive use of unctuous, heavy, sweet, slimy, cold, sour, salty substances day-sleep 'exhilaration' lack of physical exercise Ni1#25

## Pathology of K-type Fever:

When the vitiated K entering into the amasaya, getting mixed up with heat, accompanying the initial dhatu produced by digestion of food and known as rasa, blocking the channels carrying rasa and sweda, impairing agni and taking out the heat from the seat of digestion spreads it all over the body, it produces fever.

Ni1#26

## Symptoms of K-type Fever:

 emergence or aggravation of fever in the whole body simultaneously particularly immediately after meals, forenoon, early night or the spring season

 heaviness in body aversion to food excessive salivation sweetness in mouthy nausea plastering of heart cold sensation vomiting mildness of appetite excessive sleep stiffness drowsiness cough dyspnea coryza cold

whiteness in nails, eyes, face, urine, stool and skin
<!-- Page 183 -->

excessive appearance of urticarial patches in the body liking for heat unsuitability of the etiological factors suitability of factors opposite to the etiological ones Ni1#27

## Etiology of Dual- or Tri-doshic Type Fevers:

irregular meals

fasting

change in usual food

seasonal disturbances

unsuitable smell

use of poisonous water, poisonous substances

contact with the mountains

 improper administration of unction, sweating, emesis, purgation, non-unctuous and unctuous enema and head-evacuation;

improper after-evacuative dietetic regimen

women are particularly susceptible

abnormal delivery and improper post-partum management

mixing up of etiological factors mentioned earlier

(The involved etiology will determine the involved doshas.)

Ni1#28

## Symptoms of Dual-doshic or Sannipatika (Tri-doshic) Fevers:

By observing the said symptoms of fever (caused by single doshas) getting mixed up, one should know of the dual fevers or the sannipatika one.

Ni1#29

## The Exogenous Type Fever:

This is the 8th type of fever.

Ni1#30

## Etiology, Symptoms, Pathology and Types of Exogenous Types of Fevers:

 'The exogenous one is the 8th type of fever initiated with pain and caused by injury, evil organisms, spell and curse.

It remains as such for a while and later on gets associated with dosas.

 Amongst them, that caused by injury is associated with V located in affected blood;

 That caused by evil organisms with V and P and those by spell and curse with sannipata."

Ni1#30

'It' should be taken as one distinguished from other 7 types of fever because of
<!-- Page 184 -->

having specific symptoms, treatment and etiology.

It is, however, treated with general therapeutic measures.

Ni1#31

Thus eightfold genesis of fever is said.

Ni1#31

## Prodromal Symptoms of [All Types] of Fever:

 These are the prodromal symptoms which appear before the rise of temperature and also continue in the stage of pyrexia:

loss of taste in the mouth,

heaviness in body parts

aversion to food

congestion in eyes

lachrymation

oversleep

uneasiness

yawning

bending

trembling

Ni1#33

## Spiritual Etiology of Fever:

it is caused by the anger of Maheshwara

Ni1#35
<!-- Page 185 -->

# Symptoms [and Secondary Complications] of [All Types of] Fever:

 it takes away the life of all living beings [charaka describes elsewhere that fever is always present at death]

 causes disturbance in body, sense organs and mind diminishes intellect, strength, complexion, pleasure and enthusiasm produces tiredness, exhaustion, confusion and difficulty in intake of food it is called jwara because it brings about unhappiness in the person no other disease is so severe, complicated and difficult in management as this. It is the king of all diseases and is known by different terms in various animals.

 All living beings are born with fever and die with it, it is the great bewilderment, oppressed by it the living beings do not recollect any event of their previous birth, fever itself takes away the life of the living beings in the end.

## Differentiating Psychic and Somatic [(of the body)] Fevers:

 (Though fever is by nature psychosomatic), the somatic fever first arises in the body while the psychic fever starts with the mind.

Ci11#36
<!-- Page 187 -->

#### Symptoms of Psychic Fever:

 Mental detraction, restlessness and malaise are the symptoms of psychic heat (affliction).

Ci11#36

# Somatic Fever Causes Psychic Abnormality:

"Pyrexia also causes abnormality in senses."

Ci11#36

Fever predominant in V and P creates desire for cold

Fever predominant in V and K creates desire for hot

Fever predominant in V, P and K creates desire for both cold and hot.

Ci11#37

# Synergistic/ Changeable Nature of V:

"V is a good synergist which exerts both types of action on combination";

When V is combined with agni (P) it produces HEAT.

When V is combined with "soma" (K) it produces COLD.

Ci11#38

[Duplicate this above paragraph to the section on V.]

# Symptoms of Internal Fever:

 More internal heat, thirst, delirium, increased respiration, giddiness, pain in joints and bones, lack of perspiration, obstruction in (elimination of) dosas and feces.

Ci11#39-40

#### Symptoms of External Fever:

 Excessive external heat, mildness of thirst, etc. along with easy curability. Ci11#41

#### Seasonal Influence On Fever:

 The natural [notice the use of this word "natural"] fever arisen in the seasons of spring and autumn is easily curable.

 P, being hot itself, gets aggravated further by hot and is thus vitiated in the autumn [which is, according to the calendar of India's climate, a time of hot weather resurgence].

Likewise, K accumulated in the cold (season) gets aggravated in the spring.

 In the rainy season, P is accumulated due to water and plants having amlavipaka (acidity on digestion) and the same being vitiated due to (intense) heat of the autumn gives rise to fever quickly.
<!-- Page 188 -->

Here K associates as a subsidiary factor.

 In such condition, there is no harm by fasting because of the nature of visarga (releasing).

 On the other hand, K is accumulated due to sweet water and plants during hemanta (early winter) and gets vitiated in spring due to heat of the sun.

 Hence the person suffers from fever due to K in spring in the middle of the adana (recieving) period.

Here V and P are associated as subsidiary factors.

Ci11#42-46

 The wise physician should treat the case of fever in autumn and early spring by considering strength and weakness of dosas in the beginning, the end and the middle.

Ci11#47

 The fever is termed as prakrta (natural) on the basis of prakrti (nature) of time but the V fever even a prakrta one is often troublesome.

 The fever arisen in seasons other than that responsible for vitiation of the concerned dosa is known as 'vaikrta' (unnatural) which is troublesome.

 "It's various causes [relative to seasonal influence?] have been mentioned in the section on diagnosis."

Ci11#48-49

## Prognosis of Fever:

## Curable:

 if it is free from complications and is in persons having much strength and a little morbidity.

Fatal:

 if it is caused by numerous and potent etiological factors, has numerous symptoms and destroys the senses quickly.

The person is killed within 7, 10 or 12 days:

 In acute fever associated with delirium, giddiness and dyspnea kills the person in a week, 10 or 12 days.

## Incurable:

 Deep-seated, long-standing and severe fever and the one which marks the parting line of the hair (particularly) in emaciated and swollen persons is incurable.

Ci11#50-52

## Santata Jwara (Remittent Fever):

 The heavy dosas spread all over the body through the channels carrying rasa and stiffened give rise to santata jwara.

 Being unbearable and quick-acting it gets subsided or kills the patient by the period of 7, 10 or 12 days.

 Dosa equal in respect of time, dusya (affected tissue) and constitution and having no counter-acting factor causes the remittent fever and as such is quite unbearable.

 In remittent fever, as a rule, the doshas also effect urine and feces simultaneously as the dhatus.

 This fever gets subsided or becomes fatal in periods of a week etc. [[[7, 10 or12 days]]] according to condition whether the dhatus have been purified completely or not.

 When they are not purified completely or entirely the remittent fever gets lodged in the 12 entities (7 dhatus, 3 doshas, urine and feces).
<!-- Page 189 -->

Thus even after remission on 12th day, it continues hidden for a long time without responding to any treatment.

Considering all this, the physician should treat the case of fever.

Mostly in such management desaturating remedy is administered at first.

Ci11#53-60

## Satataka Jwara:

 Dosa often lodged in rakta dhatu and with some counteracting factor causes satataka jwara which rises and falls according to corresponding time.

The satataka jwara rises twice in 24 hours.

Ci11#61-62

## Anyeduska Jwara (quotidian fever):

 Anyeduska jwara is caused by dosa which getting support from one of the factors such as time, constitution and dusya obstructs the vessels carrying medas in the presence of the counteracting factor.

In this, fever rises once in 24 hours.

 The dosha lodged in asthi (bone) and majja (marrow) causes Tertian and Quartan Fevers.

The paroxysm of dosa is at the interval of 2 days, one day or daily.

 The others describe otherwise such as– quotidian fever is caused by the dosa even if it is lodged in rakta. If it goes to the channels of mamsa, it causes tertian fever while it gives rise to quartan fever if it is lodged in the channels of medas.

 The quotidian fever comes daily, the tertian on a day's interval and the quartan at the interval of 2 days.

Ci11#63-67

Why fever returns/ How doshas hide in the dhatus:

 As a seed lies dormant in the soil (for a while) and grows up in (favorable) time, dosas stay in dhatus and get vitiated in opportune time.

 The dosa having attained exacerbation and timely strength due to the weakening of the counteracting factor gives rise to the tertian as well as the quartan fever. -#68- 69

 After paroxysm, the dosas being weakened stay in their respective places and being reinforced in their opportune times again give rise to fever.

Ci11#70

## Tertian Fever:

- 3 Types of Tertian Fever:
- 1) due to K and P starting from trika (sacral region)
- 2) due to V and K starting from the back
- 3) due to V and P starting from head

Ci11#71

## The 2 Types of Quartan Fever:

- 1) caused by K and starting from the legs
- 2) caused by V and starting from the head

Ci11#72

The other types of Visama Jwara (remittent fever):

is the reverse quartan fever: which is caused by the 3 doshas separately situated in
<!-- Page 190 -->

2 dhatus (asthi and majja).

Ci11#73

5 Types of Intermittent Fever:

 are often due to combinations of all the 3 doshas but practically the dominant one is called as the cause.

Ci11#74

Fever rises in a particular time due to strength or otherwise of the season, day and night, dosas and deeds.

## Symptoms of Sannipatajwara:

momentary sensations of heat and cold, pain in bone joints and head; tearful, dirty, red and crooked eyes, ears with tinnitus and pain, throat as if covered with awns, drowsiness, fainting, delirium, cough, dyspnea, anorexia, giddiness;

tongue as if charred and roughened, excessive laxity in organs, hemoptysis, turning of head, thirst, insomnia, cardiac pain, delayed and little elimination of sweat, urine and feces, limbs not much emaciated, continuous groaning, appearance of rashes and blackish and reddish patches, muteness, inflammation in channels, heaviness in abdomen and delayed digestion of dosas.

Ci11#105-108

# Prognosis of Sannipata Jwara:

Sannipata jwara is incurable of dosas are bound up (not eliminated), power of digestion is lost and the symptoms are present in entirety and full.

Otherwise it is curable with difficulty.

Ci11#109

"The specific features of dual and aggregate fevers should be known by the features of the 3 types of individual fever already described in the section on diagnosis" [book 1; add in].

"The exogenous fever, the 8<sup>th</sup> one, is mentioned as of four types such as caused by injury, ill attachment, exorcism and cursing." [what is this the 8<sup>th</sup> one of?]

### Ci11#111

### The 4 Types of Exogenous Fever:

caused by injury caused by ill attachment caused by exorcism caused by cursing Ci11#112

### Detail on Fever caused by Injury:

It comes forth where the body is injured with weapon, brickbat, whip, wood stick, fist, slap, teeth or other such means.

In such condition, due to injury V gets aggravated and often affecting blood produces fever along with pain, swelling, abnormality and color and distress.

Ci11#113

Fever caused by ill attachment with passion, anxiety, fear or anger and also by infection of organisms is known as 'abhisangja jwara'.

Passion, anxiety and fear aggravate P and infection of organisms aggravates all 3 dosas manifesting symptoms according to the organism concerned.

8 types of such syndromes have been described in the context of bhutas (evil spirits or organisms).

Some also take the fever caused by poisonous air as aghisangaja which gets pacified by the anti-poison treatment.

## Ci11#116-124

 In some cases, fever rises before, the above symptoms appear while in other cases it comes forth after them or simultaneously with them.

 The features of the fevers caused by passion etc. are also found in other diseases caused by them.

(In fact the above symptoms are psychosomatic).

 On infliction of mind with passion etc. the fever does not get strength until the body is affected with the doshas.

 Similarly, on infliction of the body with the doshas, the fever does not get hold until the mind is affected with passion etc.

Ci11#125-127

"The exogenous fevers are at first un-stinted, but later on get the symptoms combined with those of innate factors. They are also specific in respect of etiology and therapeutics."

Ci11#128

## General Picture of Pathology of Fever:

The vitiated dosas, duals, aggregate or single, associate them with rasa dhatu
<!-- Page 194 -->

while expelling the agni from it's place and adding to the body-heat with their own heat and the heat of (displaced) agni, also blocking the channels spread all over the body with aggravation and thus produce pyrexia.

The patient gets his entire body heated and thus is said as suffering from fever.

Ci11#129-131

The patient of fever does not get perspiration due to blocking of channels.

Ci11#132

During the stage of Acute or Immature Fever:

he suffers from anorexia, indigestion and heaviness in abdomen.

Ci11#133

[The following are perhaps the 3 stages that all fevers undergo, with their symptoms]: Symptoms of ama (immature) fever:

 Impurity of heart, drowsiness, lassitude, continuous and high fever, nonelimination of dosas, excessive salivation, nausea, loss of appetite, distaste in mouth, limbs as stiffened, numbed and heavy, polyurea, stool immature and absence of emaciation. -#134-135

Symptoms of pacyamana (maturing) fever:

 High fever, thirst, delirium, dyspnea, giddiness, elimination of excrements and nausea. - Ci11#136

Symptoms of nirama (mature) fever:

 Appetite, emaciation, lightness in body, mild fever, elimination of dosas, passing of 8 days.

Ci11#137

## TREATMENT OF FEVER

\*\*\*\*\* Things to avoid in Acute fever:

day-sleep,

bath, \*

massage,

solid diet, \*

sexual intercourse,

anger,

wind, \*

 exercise and also extracts (of drugs). \*

Lightening therapy:

This is recommended as the first step in treatment of fever.
<!-- Page 195 -->

Ci11#139

Contra-indications of Lightening Therapy in Treatment of Fever:

 Yet it should not be used in fever caused by wasting, V, fear, anger, passion, anxiety and exertion.

Ci11#139

Benefits of Lightening Therapy:

 morbidity is alleviated and (digestive) fire is kindled, consequently "apyreria" [[apyrexia??], lightness and appetite arise.

Ci11#140

Necessity of Doing Lightening Therapy According to the Strength of the Patient:

 Lightening therapy which does not conflict with the strength of the patient should be applied because health depends on strength which the therapeutic management is intended for..

Ci11#141

Treatment of acute fever:

 In acute fever lightening, sweating, **time** [just waiting; the dosas will be digested by agni in time, while fasting], gruels and bitters are digestive for immature dosas.

Ci11#142

[Treatment of Acute Fever]:

 On appearance of prodromal symptoms or in the beginning of fever, light food or saturation is advised because fever originates from amasaya.

 Afterwards, intake of extracts, massage, unction, fomentation, pasting, sprinkling, afterpaste, emesis, purgation, non-unctuous and unctuous enema, pacificatory measures, snuffing, fumigation, smoking, collyrium, milk and dietetic regimen are administered properly according to condition.

Ni1#36

[Treatment of Chronic Fever]:

 However, in all types of 'jirna jwara' (chronic fever), intake of ghee cooked with proper drugs is recommended because ghee pacifies V due to unctuousness, pacifies K due to processing [being processed with drugs], pacifies P and heat due to coldness, hence in all chronic fevers, ghee is wholesome like water is for something being burned by fire.

 As they sprinkle water on a burning house to subdue a fire, ghee is administered in chronic fever. - Ni1#37

'Here are the verses':

 Ghee pacifies V due to unctuousness, P due to cold and even K which is similar in properties due to processing (with drugs).

 No other fat receives the properties of Samskara (processing with drugs) as ghee and that is why it is regarded as the best of fats.

Ni1#38-40

 'The idea expressed in prose is again said afterwards in verses. This is so for (further) clarification and as such the repetition is not despised.

Ni1#41

Treatment of Thirst:

Thirst in V-K fever:
<!-- Page 196 -->

give hot water

Thirst in fever caused by wine or P:

give cold water boiled with bitters

Note: both the above types of water are: appetizer, digestive, anti-pyretic,

channel-cleansing, strengthpromoting, producing relish and sweating and are wholesome. Ci11#143-144

To alleviate thirst and fever:

water

+

 musta, parpataka, usira, candana, udicya, sunthi Boil all the above. Allow it to self-cool Ci11#145

Use of Emetics:

 In fever which is caused predominantly by aggravated K situated in amasaya \*\*"with tendency to come out" and the patient is fit for vomiting the dosas should be eliminated by administering emetics.

Ci11#146

Risk of Applying Purgatives in Acute Fever:

 If emetic is administered in acute fever when the dosas are not tending to come out it is liable to produce heart disease, dyspnea, hardness in bowels and mental disturbance.

 To make and attempt to eliminate the dosas which are spread all over the body, associated with ama, seated in dhatu and extractable with difficulty is risky like making an attempt to extract juice from unripe fruits.

Ci11#147-148

Use of Gruels:

 After emesis and lightening the patient should be provided with gruels in time cooked with respective drugs starting with scum-gruel in the beginning till the fever comes down or for 6 days.

By this agni is stimulated like fire by fuel.

 Due to medication and lightness, they are appetizer, carminative for wind, urine, feces and dosas; due to being hot and liquid they are diaphoretic; due to being liquid they alleviate thirst, due to being nutrient they provide strength; due to being laxative they produce lightness and due to being suitable in fevers they act as antipyretic.

 Hence the wise physicians, from the very beginning, manage the cases of fever with gruels.

Ci11#148-152

Contra-Indications of Use of Gruels in Fever:

 It is not advised in fever associated with alcoholism, alcoholic addicts, in summer, having predominance of P and K or with upward internal hemorrhage (hemoptisys, epistaxis, etc.).

Ci11#153-154
<!-- Page 197 -->

Treatment in the Fever Cases Contra-Indicated for Gruel:

 In such cases, saturating drinks of parched paddy flour or antipyretic fruit juice should be given along with honey and sugar.

Ci11#155

Diet to be Give in Fever [concurrently with the gruels/ \{after the stage of the gruels}/ only in the case of the cases which listed above in "contraindications of use of gruels"]:

 Considering suitability and strength, these diets should be given along with green gram soup or soup of the meat of wild animals after the saturating drink is digested.

 At the time of meal, the patient should be advised to brush his teeth with a twig which has taste contrary to that of his mouth and is according to his liking.

 This produces non-sliminess in mouth, desire for food and drinks and sharpened perception of the taste sensation.

 After cleaning his teeth with the plant-twig and washing his mouth many times, he should take meal along with curd-water, sugarcane juice, wine etc. as directed.

Ci11#156-159

In case of fever, after 6 days have passed, the physician after giving light diet should administer digestive or pacifying extract of herbs.

Ci11#160

Contra-Indication of [Astringent] Extracts During Acute Stage of Fever:

 If extracts are administered in acute fever they bind up the dosas due to astringency which are held up without being digested and thus cause visamajwara (intermittent fever).

 In fact, extract as preparation is not contra-indicated in acute fever but the extract of astringent drugs.

Ci11#160-162

Diet for [first 10 days/ 10 days following period of the use gruels/...]:

 One should eat light food along with beneficial vegetable soups, soured or unsoured, or soup of the meat of wild animals till 10 days for alleviation of fever.

Ci11#163

Use of Ghee in [mature fever with] mild K:

 Thereafter [after 10 days/ after stage of above diet/ after dosas have been welldigested] in case of fever having mild K and severe V and P and with dosas well digested, intake of ghee acts like nectar.

Ci11#164

Treatment of persistent K in fever:

 In case even after 10 days there is predominance of K and the patient is not lightened completely, the physician should not use ghee but should treat him with extracts till lightness is attained along with the diet with meat-soup because strength is necessary to overcome the disorders and meat soup provides strength.

Ci11#165-166

## Treatment of ........:

 In case of the fever causing burning sensation and thirst, having predominance of V and P, dosas constipated or discharged profusely and freedom from ama, intake of milk should be advised.

Ci11#167
<!-- Page 198 -->

## Treatment with Purgation in...:

 If the fever does not subside even by these measures, one should pacify it by purgation if the patient has unimpaired strength, musculature and agni.

Ci11#168

Removal of excrements and dosas in patients reduced [(slightly emaciated)]by fever:

In patients reduced by fever neither emesis nor purgation is beneficial.

 In such cases, the excrements should be eliminated by adequate intake of milk or administration of non-unctuous enema.

 Non-unctuous enema, if applied on full maturity of dosas, provides strength, digestive power, freedom from fever, happiness and relish quickly.

Ci11#169-170

Role of Purgation and Enema:

 Purgation- eliminates P or K-P situated in the pittasaya Enema- eliminates all 3 doshas situated in the pakvasaya

Ci11#171

In chronic fever when K and P are reduced, appetite is firm and stool is rough and constipated, unctuous enema should be applied.

Ci11#172

In chronic fever if there are heaviness and pain in head and senses are blocked headevacuation should be applied which also provides relish.

Ci11#173

Use of Massage, Anointing, Sprinkling and Baths:

 The physician should advise massage, anointing, sprinkling and bath, cold or hot, as necessary.

 By these, the fever situated in external passages is pacified, organs get pleasure and strength and complexion are promoted.

Ci11#174-175

Use of incense and collyrium:

 the cases of chronic fever having remnant only in skin and where there is association of some extrinsic factor get relief from 'applications' of incense and collyrium. [locally]

Ci11#176

Drugs Used For Treating Fever:

The old [aged] cereals of red sali, sastika etc. are recommended for use in the forms of
<!-- Page 199 -->

gruel, boiled rice and parched paddy which alleviate fever.

Ci11#271

 [Here follows a few paragraphs information on lightening and light and heavyness]

Contra-indications for Lightening Therapy in Fever Treatment:

 Lightening is not indicated in the fever caused by V, exertion, injury and the chronic one.

Ci11#272

Proper Treatment for \{the above-mentioned cases}[the light/depletion] fever:

These cases should be managed with pacificatory measures.
<!-- Page 212 -->

Ci11#273

Movement of Dosas and Agni in Amasaya and Dhatus:

 As the dosas, having thrown out the gastric fire and circulating along the rasa produce fever, the power of digestion diminishes.

 Even the increased fire under the stove with plenty of fuel will not cook food in the cooking pot if the fire is blown aside by a wind. In this same way, when the digestive fire gets thrown out of its normal location by dosas in the patient of fever, it can not digest the food taken or it can only digest light food with difficulty.

It is because of this that management with lightening etc. has been prescribed.

Ci11#274-276

\*\*\* Natural Processing of Dosas [by the Dhatu's Agnis] in 7 Days:

\*\*\* Dosas entered into the 7 dhatus get digested in the period of a week.

 That is why the fever is said as mature on the 8th day. - Ci11#277 Consequence of Heavy Food Intake in Fever:

 The patient having diminished agni and aggravated dosas is left suddenly by the vital breath or suffers for long if he takes food particularly some heavy one.

 Because of this reason the wise physician should not prescribe diet in large quantity or excessively heavy or fatty from the start or the fever even in V fever.

Ci11#277-278

Treatment Program in Pure, Nirama V Fever:

 In V fever, if there is no association of any other dosa, massage etc. should be applied ignoring the usual procedure.

Thereafter he should be given medicinal extract and then diet with meat soup.

Other measures efficacious in chronic fever should also be adopted.

Ci11#279-280

Progress and Treatment of a K fever in a K Patient:

 In patients who are constitutionally predominant in K and deficient in V if fever comes with abundant K and low fever it does not mature even in a week due to mild agni.

 Hence he should be managed with the said lightening, light diet, etc. till 10 days and thereafter with medicinal extracts.

Ci11#281-282

Treatment of Ama, K or K-P associated with Fever:

 Fevers which are associated with ama, or are caused by K or K-P should be subject to lightening measures as described in the concerned chapter (su 22).

Ci11#283

Emesis, Purgation and Enema For Fever:

 Fever caused by K should be treated with - emesis P Purgation V Enema

Ci11#284

Treatment of Dual or Aggravated Doshas in Fever:

 In case of fever caused by dual or aggravated dosas one should prescribe proper drugs considering their comparative predominance or equality.

Ci11#285

Treatment of Sannipataja Fever:

This should be treated by increasing the diminished dosas, decreasing the
<!-- Page 213 -->

aggravated ones and keeping the condition of the location of K (amasaya) in view.

Ci11#286

Incidence and Treatment of Swelling At the Root of the Ears:

 In the end of the aggregated [sannipata] fever, severe swelling occurs at the root of the ears [ this could be, but doesn't sound like, anaphylactic shock swelling] from which one rarely survives.

 It should be treated with prompt blood-letting, intake of ghee, anointings, snuffings, and gargles which alleviate K and P. - Ci11#287-288 Treatment of Obstinate Cases with Blood-Letting:

 Fever which does not subside by treatment with cold, hot, unctuous, non-unctuous etc. and has entered into "sakha" (rakta etc.) is treated with blood-letting.

Ci11#289

Treatment of various other types of fever:

 Fever arisen due to erysipelas, injury and eruptions, is treated first with the intake of ghee if it is not predominant in K and P.

Ci11#290

 Chronic fever continues because of the debility of bodily dhatus, hence it should be managed with the diet promoting strength and body-bulk.

Ci11#291

 The usual procedure should be left in tertian and quartan fever because there is often extrinsic factor associated with the intermittent fever.

 Visamajwara which is predominant in V should be treated with ghee, enema (nonunctuous and unctuous) and fatty and hot food and drinks.

 Visamajwara ([intermittent fever]) predominant in P should be treated with purgation, milk, medicated ghee, bitter and cold drugs.

 Visamajwara predominant in K should be treated with emesis, digestives, rough diet, lightening measures, astringent and hot drugs.

Ci11#292-295

"Now I shall mention the formulations which alleviate intermittent fever." [But it seems that basic treatment for intermittent fever has just been given, above. And the following information intermittent fever is pretty general; not specific formulas].

 Concentrated wine for drink, cock, partridge and peacock in diet should be used in intermittent fever.

 The patient should take satpala ghrta or haritaki, or decoction of triphala or juice of guduci, or decoction of nilini, ajagandha, trivrta and katurohini, at the advent of the fever, after unction and fomentation, or he should take the large dose of ghee and then vomit it, or after taking plenty of meal he should vomit, or after a good meal he should take plenty of wine and then go to bed.

 In intermittent fever, one should prescribe non-unctuous or sustaining enemas or the patient should take cat's feces along with milk on the same day, or the bull's feces added with rock salt along with curd-scum or wine.

The use of pippali, triphala, curd, buttermilk, pancagavya ghrta and milk is
<!-- Page 214 -->

commended in intermittent fever.

The fever is prevented by wearing gems, auspicious herbs and poison and also by
<!-- Page 215 -->

he should be "detracted" with favorite and surprising objects.

Ci11#323

## Signs of Remission of Fever:

 During remission of fever, the patient groans, vomits, moves, respires, becomes pale, has perspired organ, trembles, faints frequently, has delirium, whole body being hot or cold, becomes unconscious and as if filled with anger during rise of fever, passes feces with impurity and sound, liquid and with force.

Ci11#324-326

 "In case the patient has profuse morbidity and the fever is acute and high, the remission occurs by crisis due to proper management and maturation of dosas.

 On the other hand, if the fever is chronic, the fever having risen due to (aggravation of)dosa gradually comes down. This is remission by lysis."

Ci11#326-328

 The patient should be taken as free from fever when exhaustion and pyrexia are gone, there is no distress, senses are clear and the psyche has revived normalcy.

Ci11#329

Items to Abstain from:

 The patient during fever or convalescence should avoid burning, heavy, unsuitable and antagonistic food and drinks.

 He should also abstain from sequal intercourse, over-work, bath and over-eating. Thus fever subsides and thereafter does not relapse.

 During convalescence one should not take exercise, sexual intercourse, bath and walking till he regains strength.

Ci11#330-332

Consequence of taking these Avoidables during convalescence:

 If one takes these avoidable food and activities during convalescence before regaining normal strength, the fever relapses.

 It also relapses even with slight mis-management in cases where temperature comes down though the dosas are not eliminated properly.

 That relapsed fever kills the patient suffering since long, debilitated and with poor agni in a short time.

 Some times dosas get matured in successive dhatus, thus they do not produce fever but cause harm to the body.

 They produce anxious expression, swelling, malaise, paleness, anorexia, itching, rashes, pimples and mildness of appetite.

 Similarly, other treated disorders too relapse on a slight unwholesome activity if dosas are not eliminated properly.

 Hence, even after the fever subsides, dosas should be eliminated or pacified according to condition, strength and vitality (of the patient).

 In such cases, evacuation with mild measures, sustaining enemas, light vegetable soup and meat-soups of the wild animals are wholesome.

 Massage, anointing, bath, incense, collyrium, bitter ghee are prescribed in relapsed fever.

 If the fever relapses due to heavy, channel-blocking and unsuitable diet, management with lightening and hot therapy as mentioned above may be done.

Ci11#333-342

The following decoction, taken regularly, destroys relapsing fever:

kiratatikta, kutaki, musta, parpataka, guduci

 + water Make a decoction with all the above.

Ci11#343

The wise physician, considering the management of fever, should treat the case according to the condition.

Ci11#344

 Fever is the king of all diseases, destroyer of all creatures and severe, hence a physician should be particularly cautious in treating it.

The physician knowing causes and symptoms should manage promptly the case of intermittent hemorrhage which is a great disease, greatly forceful and quick-acting like fire.

Ci4#5

"I will further explain how P acquires the name of 'lohita pitta' (internal hemorrhage)." Ni2#3

[Note: 'Raktapitta' and 'Lohapitta' are both synonyms for internal hemorrhage.]

## Etiology:

basically:

 Intake of sharp, sour, pungent and salty substances in excess, exposure to the sun and gastric hyperacidity.

Ci4#6

## Etiology of 'Lohita Pitta':

 taking diet consisting mostly of grains such as yavaka, uddalaka and koradusa also other food items excessively hot and sharp added with legume of nispava, black gram, horse gram and alkali;

 or with curd, curdwater, buttermilk, sour buttermilk or sour gruel; meat of pig, buffalo, sheep, fish and cow,

vegetables of oil cake, pindalu (a tuber) and dried potherbs;

 upadamsa (chutney or salad) of radish, mustard, garlic, karanja, sigru, madhusigru, kharabusa, bhustrna, sumukha, surasa, kutheraka, gandira, kalamalaka, parnasa, ksavaka and phanijjaka

 after-drink of sura (wine, sauvira, tusodaka (types of vinegar), maireya, medaka, madhulaka (fermented veverages, sukta (sour beverage), sour preparations of kuvala and badara (types of jujube),

takes preparations of (rice) flour in excess after meals:

 or excessively heated (in the sun or fire) takes unboiled milk in excessive quantity or frequently;

eats rohine (vegetable) along with milk,

 or takes kanakapota (a type of pigeon) cooked with mustard oil and alkali, or excessively exposed to heat takes milk along with sour beverages cooked with horse gram, oil cake, fruits of jambu and lakuca,

 With such types of regimen his P gets vitiated and blood exceeds it's normal measure.

 With blood exceeding it's normal measure the vitiated P, while circulating in the body, reaches the openings of blood-carrying channels originating from the liver and spleen, obstructs them which are already heavy due to congestion of blood and thus affects the blood morbidly.

Ni2#4

 P is called 'lohitapitta' because it contacts with blood, affects it and acquires it's smell and color. [[loha means iron; perhaps like rust-colored; red. Perhaps loha has other meanings]]

Ni2#5
<!-- Page 219 -->

## [Pathology]:

 P aggravated by these causes reaches rakta and because of similarity in constitution develops further at the same time affecting it (rakta).

 Due to heat of P the fluid portion from all the fomented dhatus oozes out which again leads to aggravation of P.

Ci4#7-8

## Prodromal Symptoms of Lohitapitta:

aversion to food

mal-digestion of food

eructation having smell and taste of sour gruel

frequent urge for vomiting

disgusting vomit

hoarseness of voice

malaise

spreading burning sensation

as if emittance of smoke from the mouth

smell of metal, blood, fish and mucus in the mouth

 appearance of red, green or yellow color in the body parts, feces, urine, sweat, saliva, nose-secretion, excreta from mouth and ear, and boils;

body-ache,

 frequent vision of red, blue, yellow, blackish and brilliant objects in dreams Ni2#6

## Complications of Raktapitta/ Lohapitta:

debility

anorexia

indigestion

dyspnea

cough

fever

diarrhea

odema

phthisis

anemia

hoarseness of voice

Ni2#7

## Similarity of P and Rakta:

 P itself is called as raktapitta because of "conjunction with" rakta dhatu and affecting the rakta dhatu.

[Explain the above.]

P itself is called as raktapitta because of it's similarity in smell and color to rakta.

Ci4#9

Significance of Spleen and Liver:

 The "P (raktapitta)" [or just 'rakta'?] stays located in spleen and liver because in persons the blood vessels originate from them.

Ci4#10
<!-- Page 220 -->

Signs of K raktapitta:

viscous, pale, unctuous and slimy blood coming out

Ci4#11

Signs of V raktapitta:

blackish, reddish, frothy, thin and rough blood coming out.

Ci4#11

Signs of P raktapitta:

 ochre-like, black, cow-urine-like, shining black, smoky and collyrium-like color of blood coming out.

Ci4#11

Signs of dual-doshic raktapitta:

the symptoms of the involved doshas are combined.

Ci4#12

Signs of sannipata raktapitta:

signs of all 3 doshas are present.

Ci4#12

Prognosis of raktapitta:

Raktapitta associated with 1 dosa is curable.

Raktapitta associated with 2 dosas is maintainable.

Raktapitta associated with 3 dosas is incurable.

Ci4#13

 Raktapitta is also incurable if it is severely forceful and invading the person who has poor digestion, is emaciated due to diseases, is old and is under-nourished.

Ci4#14

Delineation of Upwards Vs. Downwards-Moving Raktapitta:

Movement of raktapitta is directed upwards and downwards.

The upwards movement occurs through the 7 orifices in the head.

The downwards movement occurs through the 2 orifices in the pelvis.

Ci4#15-18

The 2 Paths of Internal Hemorrhage:

Upwards

 In persons having abundance of K, going upward in contact with K, it bleeds through ear, nose, eyes and mouth. - Ni2#8

Downwards

 In persons having abundant V, going downwards in contact with V, it bleeds through the passages of urine and feces.

Ni2#8

Both ways:

 In those having abundance of both K and V, in contact with both of them, it follows both the paths and thus bleeds through all the aforesaid orifices.

Ni2#8
<!-- Page 221 -->

#### Prognosis of Types of Internal Hemorrhage:

 upward type: is curable, because of being treatable by purgation and plenty of applicable drugs.

 Downwards type: is palliable, because of being amenable to emesis and less number of applicable drugs.

 Both ways type: is incurable, because of non-applicability of both emesis and purgation, and want of proper drugs.

Ni2#9

## Spiritual-Historical Etiology of Internal Hemorrhage:

 Vitiation of raktapitta emerged, in early times, after fever when at the time of destruction of Daksa's sacrifice the living beings were pervaded by the fire of Rudra's wrath.

Ni2#10

#### Prognosis relative to Direction of Raktapitta:

That coming through the upper passages is curable.

That coming from the lower passages is maintainable.

That coming from both upper and lower passages is incurable.

 When raktapitta flows out from all the orifices including the hair follicles it is known as with innumerable movements, and this is fatal.

Ci4#15-18

### Further Notes on Prognosis:

 Raktapitta passing out excessively through both the passages, having corpse-like smell, exceedingly red or black, associated with K and V, adhering in throat, having all the complications mentioned earlier, possessing deep yellow, blue, green or coppery color and in emaciated and coughing patient is incurable.

 The raktapitta which is associated with 2 dosas, which aggravates again and again after subsiding and shifts from one passage to another is maintainable [but not curable].

 Raktapitta which has only one passage, is in the strong person, is not very forceful, is recently arisen, in favorable season and without complication is curable.

Ci4#19-22

# Other causes of Incurability:

 Some curable disease is not treated successfully because of lack of attendants and equipments, uncontrolled self [patient] and fault of the physician.

Omission of the proper remedy also makes some disease incurable.

Incurability is one which comes gradually through curability and palliability.

Ni2#21-22

Types of Raktapitta Which are Incurable:

raktapitta which is black or blue or rainbow colored and 'stains cloth

 bleeding which is of excessively fetid smell, in large quantity and associated with all the complications particularly in weak and emaciated patients.

 The patient suffering from raktapitta sees the sky as red, the disease is certainly incurable.

Ni2#23-26

The incurable disease should be avoided, the palliable one should be managed with efforts and the curable one should be treated successfully with tried remedies.
<!-- Page 222 -->

Ni2#27

## Unctuous-hot and Rough-hot Cause Raktapitta:

Raktapitta is caused by unctuous-hot and rough-hot.

Unctuous-hot: gives rise to upward-moving raktapitta

Is associated with K

Rough-hot: gives rise to downward-moving raktapitta

Is associated with V

(Association of V and K [w/ P] gives rise to upward and downward

raktapitta.)

Ci4#23-24

## Treatment of Raktapitta:

## Treatment of Internal Hemorrhage:

In order to pacify this quick-acting and emergent condition which is like a forest fire: prompt action should be taken carefully to treat it with saturating or desaturating soft, sweet, cold bitter and astringent diet and paste, sprinklings, bath, touching, emesis etc. taking due consideration of dose, place and time.

Ni2#11

'Here are the verses':

 Raktapitta which comes upwards is curable because of applicability of purgation and abundance of useful drugs. - Ni2#12

 Purgation is the best remedy for alleviation of P and also not ineffective for K which is associated with it. - Ni2#13

Sweet drugs are also applicable there. - Ni2#13

Hence hemorrhage coming out from the upper part is curable.

Ni2#14

Hemorrhage from the lower parts is decidedly palliable because emesis is slightly applicable here and useful drugs are also a few.

 Emesis is not so efficacious for elimination of P and it is also ineffective in alleviation of V which is associated with P.

Moreover, astringent and bitter drugs are not applicable there.

Hence hemorrhage from the lower parts is regarded as palliable.

Ni2#15-17

Raktapitta which comes out from both the parts should be known as incurable from the aforesaid reasons.

 Here no evacuative measure is applicable which goes out from the path opposite to that of hemorrhage.

In raktapitta, elimination of dosa from the opposite path is recommended.

 'Likewise, there is no alround pacificatory measure for this while in combined dosas the pacificatory measure should be able to pacify all the dosas.'

Thus 3 types of raktapitta have been described according to the different paths.
<!-- Page 223 -->

Ni2#18-20

## Importance to not check raktpitta in certain cases:

 Internal hemorrhage having much impurity and excited and in a person who is not emaciated and weak and takes normal food should not be checked in the very beginning.

 If checked at the very start, it produces choking of the throat, fetid smell from the nose, fainting, anorexia, fever, gulma, spleen enlargement, hardness of bowels, leucoderma, dysuria, leprosy, piles, erysipelas, loss of complexion, fistula-in-ano, obstruction to intellect and senses.

 Hence one desiring success should ignore, at first, the internal hemorrhage started in a strong patient considering the strength and condition of the morbidity.

[this last sentence is redundant; remove.]

Ci4#25-28

Ama Involvement and Lightening Therapy:

 "Mostly the raktapitta excited by amadosa of the person aggravates, hence he should be managed with lightening measures."

 [translation: In most cases of raktapitta, it is ama which aggravates it. So, the raktapitta should be managed indirectly by managing ama with lightening therapy.] Ci4#29

Lightening or Saturating Therapy:

 The physician should apply in the beginning of raktapitta, lightening or saturating measures according to passage, association of dosa and etiology.

[So, as far as treatment in terms of passage:

 Upward-moving raktapitta, being K should be treated with lightening. Downward-moving raktapitta, being V, should be treated with uncting/ "saturating" (if it is relatively nirama).] Ci4#30

Drinks to Use:

The patient who feels thirsty should be given this drink:

hribera, candana, usira, musta and prapataka

+

water

Boil the above together. - Ci4#31

Or the patient may be given cooled boiled water.

Ci4#31

 One having knowledge of constitution and preparation should prescribe saturating drink in upward raktapitta and liquid gruel in downward raktapitta [note: this contradicts my statement above] considering time, suitability and association of dosas.

Ci4#32

The following is a saturating drink to use:

kharjura

Mrdwika (fruits)

Madhuka (dry flowers)

Parusaka (fruit)

Water

Boil the above together.
<!-- Page 224 -->

+ sugar Mix all together. Serve cooled. Ci4#33

 The following saturating "preparation" [not a drink], if taken timely, alleviates the upward-moving raktapitta:

 Powder of parched paddy + honey, ghee [but no water/ liquid...] Ci4#34

 These additions may be made to the saturating preparation if the patient has poor digestion and is suited to sour things:

 pomegranates amalaka fruits Ci4#35

Diet in Raktapitta:

 The patient of raktapitta should take meal consisting of the cereals of sali, sastika, nivara, koradusa, prasantika, syamaka and priyangu.

 For them, gram, lentils, green grams, makustha and adhaki are commended for the pulse-soup.

 The vegetables useful in raktapitta are patola, nimba, tip of vetra, tender leaves of plaksa and vetasa, kiratitkta, gandira and kathillaka.

 The flowers of kovidara, kasmarya and salmali are also used as vegetable in diet and also similar substances which alleviate raktapitta.

These vegetables should be prepared by boiling or frying with ghee or like soup and given to the vegetarian patients as vegetable.

 Dove, pigeon, common quail, raktaksa (crane), vartaka (a quail), grey partridge, ena, harina and kalapucchaka (types of deer) are wholesome in raktapitta. Their soups are used soured or unsoured, fried with ghee and added with sugar.

In raktapitta associated with K: vegetable soup is good.

In raktapitta associated with V: meat soup is prescribed.

Ci4#36-39

Ci4#52

Items to Avoid:

 Whatever etiological factors of raktapitta have been mentioned should not be used by the patients of raktapitta if they wish to survive and to be free from the disease.

Ci4#53

The Management of Strong Patients having Plenty of Dosas:

 Raktapitta arisen due to over-saturation in a strong patient who has no emaciation and debility but the disorder is enormous should be treated with evacuative therapy by purgation (in upward type) and emesis (in downward type). This should be done in a proper time schedule, and only if the patient is fit for such therapy and if the disease has no complication.

Ci4#54-55

[Upward raktapitta may be treated by downward purgation.

[Downward raktapitta may be treated by upward emesis.]

The following is a purgative formula to be used [[in upward r.]]:

## Hikka (Hiccup) and Swasa (Dyspnea)

Diagnosis

Etiology Symptoms The 5 Types of Hiccup The 5 Types of Swasa (Dyspnea)

 Treatment General Treatment Emesis Treating Strong Vs. Weak Patients Diet- soups Formulas General Treatment
<!-- Page 242 -->

There are many fatal diseases but they do not take away the life so quickly as hiccup and dyspnea. -Ci27#6

 Moreover, in the person suffering from the other various disorders, severe hiccup or dyspnea arises at the end.

Ci27#7

Hikka and swasa are predominant in K and V. [both]

 They arise from the seat of P [the small intestine?] and dry up the heart and the dhatus.

 Hence, both hiccup and dyspnea being similar are regarded as very difficult to overcome and if managed badly they get aggravated further and kill the patients like serpents.

Ci27#8-9

 In the chapter on enumeration of diseases (Su. 19) each of them has been said as of 5 types.

Etiology for Hiccup and Dyspnea:

 These 2 diseases arise due to dust, smoke, wind, residing in cold place and using cold water, physical exertion, sexual intercourse, traveling on foot, intake of rough food, irregular meals, vitiation of ama, distention of bowels, roughness, oversaturation, debility, injury to vital parts, use of duals (cold and hot etc.) together and excessive evacuation.

 They may arise as complications in diseases such as diarrhea, fever, vomiting, coryza, chest injury with wasting, internal hemorrhage, upward movement of V, visucika, alasaka, panduroga and poisoning.

 They also arise due to intake of nispava, black gram, oil cake, sesamum and oil, flour preparations, tubers, distending, burning and heavy food, aquatic and marshy meat, curd, unboiled milk, channel-blocking regimens and use of K-aggravating things leading to obstruction in throat and chest and various other sorts of retention.

Ci27#10-16

Pathology:

 V situated in chest entering into the channels carrying vital breath is vitiated and enforcing the K further gives rise to hiccup and dyspnea (each of 5 types) which are of severe nature and impede the vital breath in living creatures.

Ci27#17

Prodromal Symptoms of Hiccup:

 Heaviness in throat and chest, astringency in mouth and gurgling sound in abdomen.

Ci27#19

Prodromal Symptoms of Dyspnea:

 Hardness in bowels, pain in sides, compression in cardiac region, mis-passage of vital breath [what does that mean; breath coming into esophagus instead of larynx?]

Ci27#20

Etiology of Hiccup:

 V along with K obstructs the channels of vital breath, water and food and thus produce hiccup.

## Prognosis:

 Hiccup arisen in a person having great accumulation of dosas, weakened due to discontinuance of food, emaciated due to diseases, old age and indulged in excessive sexual intercourse takes away the life quickly.

 Yamika (having double bouts) associated with delirium, distress, thirst and fainting is fatal.

 Yamika is curable if the patient is not emaciated, anxious and possesses firm dhatus and senses; otherwise it is fatal.

Ci27#42-44

## Etiology of Swasa:

 When V preceded by K obstructs the passages and itself being obstructed moves here and there, it produces swasa.

Ci27#45

The 5 Types of Swasa:

| Type of     | Etiology, Pathology and Symptoms:                                                    |

| Mahaswasa   | The patient with upward force of V respires highly with obstruction, sound and       |
|             | discomfort constantly like a mad bull.                                               |
|             | He loses all sorts of knowledge, has rolling eyes and face, retention of urine and   |
|             | feces, fallen voice, anxious expression and excessive respiration known from         |
|             | distance.                                                                            |
|             | This is highly fatal.                                                                |

| Swasa       | covered with phlegm, is afflicted by vitiated V, gazes abnormally with eyes up       |
|             | and rolling eyeballs, has fainting, pain, dryness of mouth and restlessness, due to  |
|             | vitiation of expiration, the inspiration is impeded, the patient faints time and     |
|             | again and becomes unconscious and finally dies.                                      |
| "Cchinna    | One who afflicted in entire vital breath respires intermittently or does not respire |

|            | He suffers from hoarseness of voice and can speak with difficulty.               |
|            | In lying posture dyspnea is aggravated and he can't sleep because in that        |

|            | suffers frequently from paroxysms of dyspnea which aggravates by clouds,         |
|            | water, cold, easterly wind and K-increasing things.                              |
|            | This type of swasa can be maintained or can be cured if it is newly arisen.      |

Ci27#46-65

## Prognosis:

 In strong patients all the types swasas are curable if they are not manifest fully. Ci27#66

Treatment of Hikka and Swasa:

 Of them these fatal ones should be rejected because they are very severe and galloping. - Ci27#68

 The other types which are curable and maintainable should be managed by the physician quickly with proper medicaments because if neglected they may reduce the body to ashes like the fire burning the dried tree.

Ci27#69

Identical Management for Hikka and Swasa:

 Both hikka and swasa are managed identically due to their identical etiology, location and root.

Ci27#70

General Management:

There are 4 stages: [see notes @ strong vs. weak trtmnt; weak won't get
<!-- Page 246 -->

emesis/ purgation]

I: massage and Unctuous Fomentation

II: Pre-emesis diet for vitiating K in stomach

III: Emesis

IV: Smoking to remove remaining ama

Ci27#71-72

## Step I; Unctuous Fomentation:

 The patient of hiccup and dyspnea should, at first, be managed with unctuous sudation by tubular, bed and bolus methods after he is massaged with salted oil. Ci27#73

[Note: no oil is given internally.] [Note: oil, not ghee or other heavy

sbstnce] \*\* By this his "inspissated" phlegm into the channels gets dissolved and thereby the passages become soft and V returns to it's normal course.

 [So here is shown that external oil massage and fomentation -without internal oleation- is sufficient to get ama and doshas to move out of the tissues and back to the main channels.]

 \*\* As on hilly forests the snow is liquefied by the heat of sun-rays, the sticky phlegm in the body gets dissolved by the heat of sudation. [This is so simple a concept/ explanation]

Ci27#74

Step II; Pre-emesis Diet:

 After full sudation the patient should be given the diet consisting of rice with uncting substance along with meat soup of fish or boar or with the supernatant fatty layer of curd. [moderately heavy, K increasing substances.]

Ci27#75

Step III; Emesis:

 In this way, when K is increased, he should be advised to take emesis [emetic formula] mixed with pippali, rock salt and honey [a nice K and V reducing emetic mix] and "which is not very antagonistic to V".

 On elimination of deranged phlegm he gets relief and V also starts moving unimpeded after the channels are cleansed.

Ci27#76

Step IV; Smoking to Remove Remaining [Morbidity/K/Phlegm]:

 If some pathogenic material still remains hidden, it should be eliminated by smoking. - Ci27#77

Here follows a few smoking formulas which may be used:

This formula should be smoked:

 haridra, patra, eranda (root), lac, realgar, devadaru, orpiment, mamsi Powder all the above together.

Make into sticks.

 To use, smear a stick with ghee and smoke [on a pipe?; see "Dhuman Chart"]. Ci27#77

The following formula may be used:

Barley grains
<!-- Page 247 -->

+

ghee

Mix the above together. [other processing?].

Smoke.

Ci27#78

The following may be used:

 "Bee-wax\*, sarjarasa and ghee are put together in the closed space between the 2 earthen plates. In this [the closed space between 2 earthen plates/ \{with the above formula}] horns, hairs and ligaments of cow (or bull) may be smoked."[this may be 1 big formula or 2 smaller formulas.]

Ci27#79

The following formula may be used:

 "The dried tubular leaf-stalks of syonaka and eranda or kusa or padmaka, guggulu, aguru and sallaki \*mixed with ample ghee\* should be smoked." [the tubular stalks may be used as the body of a pipe, like a cigarette. Ghee (and other ingredients) may be smeared on them. I'm also not sure how many of the items above are tubes, and how many are to be powdered to be pasted on the other tubes...]

Ci27#80

 Hiccup and dyspnea associated with feeble voice, diarrhea, internal hemorrhage and burning sensation should be managed with sweet, unctuous and cold regimen etc.

Ci27#81

Contraindications of Sudation in Hikka-Swasa:

 Sudation should not be applied to those suffering from P, burning sensation, profuse hemorrhaging or sweating, loss of dhatus and strength and those who are roughened, pregnant or of P constitution.

Ci27#82

Detail on Fomentation:

 The region of chest and throat should be fomented as desired with warm sprinkling of uncting substance mixed with sugar or with soft poultices of utkarika (a dietary preparation) for a very short period. - Ci27#83

For this, the following formula may be used:

Utkarika prepared of:

 Sesamum, linseed Black gram

Wheat

+

 V-alleviating substances Uncting substances Sour things or Milk

Ci27#84

In case of acute fever and ama dosa:

 Rough sudation and lightening or emesis with salt water should be advised according to condition.
<!-- Page 248 -->

Ci27#85

If V is aggravated due to excessive application of these regimens:

 It should be brought to normalcy by administering V-alleviating regimens, meat soup etc, with moderate heat and massages.

Ci27#86

In condition of reverse movement of V and tympanitis:

 Food mixed with matulunga and amlavetasa or hingu, pilu and bida (salt) should be taken. This acts as a carminative.

Ci27#87

- \*\* There Are Two Categories of Hikka and Swasa:
- \* Among patients of hiccup and dyspnea, one group consists of strong ones and the other of weak ones.
- \* The strong group:

is dominant in K while

The weak group:

is rough and is dominant in V.

[Duplicate this valuable info to beginning of this chptr., with diagnosis sctn.]

 \*\* Treatment of Hikka and Swasa in the Strong group, predominant in K: Emesis and purgation should be administered keeping the patient on wholesome diet followed by pacificatory management with smoking and linctus etc. Ci27#89

\*\* Treatment of Hikka and Swasa in the Weak group, predominant in V:

 In patients having predominance of V and debility and in children and old persons, saturating management should be applied with V-alleviating and pacificatory uncting substances vegetable and meat soups etc.

Ci27#90

\* Importance of Not Evacuating Depleted Patient:

 By administering evacuative treatment to the patients in whom K is not excited and who are unformed and weak, V finds place and by drying up the vital organ takes away life instantaneously. - Ci27#91

 Hence those having strength and dominance of K should, at first, be saturated with meat soup of marshy or aquatic animals, fomented and thereafter evacuated. - Ci27#92

 The patients of the opposite group [(weak, V)] should be subjected to promotive measures [skipping the evacuation entirely]]. - Ci27#92

 \* For them, meat of peacock, partridge, cock and wild animals and birds cooked in decoction of dasamula or horse gram is wholesome.

Linctus formulations should not be used if K is not present.

Ci27#120

\*\* Necessity to Keep the Path of V Clear:

\* General Strategy:

 Whatever drug or diet alleviates K and V, is hot and carminative is wholesome for one suffering from dyspnea and hiccup. - Ci27#147

- \* Strategy about Lightening or Pacifying:
- \* Single-sided treatment such as K-alleviating but V-aggravating or V-alleviating but K-aggravating should not be done in these cases.
- \* However, between these 2 the V-alleviating measures are preferable.
- \* In all cases, there is little and manageable risk in administering promoting regimen, and in pacifying measures.
- \* But the risk is too much [a lot] and unmanageable in lightening (or reducing) measures .
- \* Hence the patients of hiccup and dyspnea evacuated or unevacuated, should be managed mostly with promotive and pacifying measures.

 Faulty practices, deranged menstrual flow, defect in ovum and fate. Ci30#8

Etiology of V Yonivyapat:

 Occurs in the woman of V constitution following V-aggravating diet and practices.

Ci30#9

Pathology and Symptoms of V Vyapat:

 V gets aggravated and having been located in the genital tract produces piercing and other types of pain, stiffness, feeling of crawling of ants, hardness and numbness of vagina, exhaustion and other V disorders.

 Due to V her menstrual discharge appears with sound, painful, frothy, thin and rough.

Ci30#10

Etiology of P Yonivyapat:

Ci30#11

Pathology and Symptoms of P Yonivyapat:

 Because of affection with P, the genital tract suffers from burning sensation, inflammation, fever and heat.

 The menstrual flow is blue, yellow or black and with excessive, hot discharge having cadaverous smell.

Ci30#12

Etiology of K Yonivyapat:

 K gets aggravated by channel-blocking things and thus effects the genital tract. Ci30#13

Pathology and Symptoms of K Yonivyapat:

 Aggravated K makes the track as slimy, cold, itching, with mild pain and pale. The menstrual flow is pale and slimy.

Ci30#14

Tridoshic Yonivyapat:

 When a woman uses excessively all the rasas, all 3 dosas located in the genital tract and uterus produce their symptoms there.

 Thus the tract suffers from burning sensation and pain an has discharge as white and slimy. (Typical "Leucorrhea"\*\*\*)

## MALE IMPOTENCY

Diagnosis

Etiology Due to Loss of Semen Due to Loss of Penile Strength Due to Senility Due to Genetic Defect

 Treatment General Treatment
<!-- Page 277 -->

Cause of Impotency:

 "As impotency caused by the defect of semen is cured by elimination of the defect itself, now I will describe as it." - Ci30#153

 Due to loss of seed (semen) and penile strength, senility and deficiency of semen, impotency arises.

Ci30#154

General Symptoms of Impotency:

 One constantly with firm determination does not cohabit even with beloved and submissive woman because of looseness of penis or if cohabits sometimes he starts panting with profuse perspiration, fruitless determination and effort, depressed penis and without semen.

Ci30#155-157

Causes of Impotency Due to Loss of Seed [Semen]:

 Due to intake of cold, rough, little, mixed, incompatible and uncooked food; grief, anxiety, fear and terror, indulgence in women, exorcism, suspicion, deficiency of dhatus, imbalance of doshas, fasting, exertion, ignorance of the taste for women, faulty application of 5 evacuative measures, seed (semen) is impaired

Ci30#158-161

Symptoms of Impotency Due to Loss of Seed [Semen]:

 and consequently the person becomes pale, too weak, of low vitality, with little erection to women, affected with cardiac disorder, anemia, bronchial asthma, jaundice, exhaustion, vomiting, diarrhea, colic, cough and fever.

Ci30#158-161

Symptoms of Impotency Due to Loss of Penile Strength:

Swelling, pain and redness in penis; appearance of acute boils, inflammation in penis, abnormal growth therein, appearance of ulcers with discharge like pulaka (rice) water or blackish or reddish in colour, ring-like hardness in circumference of the penis, fever, thirst, giddiness, fainting, vomiting, red, black, blue or violet discharge, burn-like intense sensation with pain "in pelvis, testicles, suture and groins"; sometimes there is slimy or pale discharge, mild swelling with feeling of wetness and little discharge, delayed inflammation and quick recovery; appearance of maggots, moisture, foul odor, necrosis of gland, penis and testicles.

Ci30#169-175

Thus is described the impotency due to loss of penile strength.

Some say it as 5 types.

Ci30#175

Causes of Impotency Due to Loss of Penile Strength: [put this in front of 'symptoms']

 Due to intake of excessively sour, salty, alkaline, incompatible and unsuitable food; drinking too much water, irregular meals, intake of floury and heavy preparations, regular use of curd, milk, and meat of marshy animals, reduction from illness, coitus with female child and in non-vagina; cohabitation lustfuly and ignorantly with woman having chronic illness, left since long, in periods, with foul odour, having defective genital track and excessive discharge, intercourse with quadrupeds, injury to phallus, non-washing of penis, wound in penis by sharp instruments, teeth or nails, or its pressing or striking with
<!-- Page 278 -->

wooden stick, excessive use of awny insects (in order to elongate the organ) and holding back semen.

Ci30#162-168

Cause of Impotency Due to Senility:

Age is of 3 categories: inferior, average and superior.

 Often semen is diminished in too old persons particularly due to deficiency of dhatus, not using aphrodisiacs, gradual decay of strength, energy and sensory as well as motor organs, deterioration in life-span, want of nutrition, physical exertion and mental exhaustion. Because of these factors, impotency arises in old age.

Ci30#176-178

Symptoms of Impotency Due to Senility:

 The person becomes exceedingly wasted in dhatus, debilitated, devoid of normal complexion, with poor expression and falls prey to disease shortly.

Ci30#179-180

"Now listen about the 4th one caused by deficiency (of semen)."

## Cause [and Symptoms] of Impotency Due to Loss of Semen:

Due to excessive mental work, grief, anger, fear, envy, curiosity, intoxication and agitation, regular use of rough diet and drugs by the emaciated one, fasting by the debilitated one and intake of little food:

 Rasa, the chief of the dhatus, located in the heart, is diminished quickly resulting in deficiency of other dhatus beginning with blood and ending with semen.

Of them, semen is the excellent resort.

 Or, if one indulges in intercourse due to over-exhilaration of the mind [lust], his semen is diminished and he is reduced.

Consequently he falls prey to some severe disease or even death.

Hence one, desirous of health, should particularly protect the semen.

Ci30#181-185

"Thus four-fold impotency is described."

Ci30#186

Some say 2 types of impotency as incurable and also by excision of penis and castration.

 [[There are 2 types of incurable impotency, in addition to excision of penis and castration, which also cause incurable impotency.]]

Ci30#187

Cause and Symptoms of Impotency Due to Genetic Defect:

 Due to genetic defect of parents and inauspicious past deeds, when dosas, in fetus, having reached the semen-carrying vessels dry them up resulting in destruction of semen, the man even though endowed fully with all the organs behaves like a non-man.

Ci30#188-189

These [which?] are said as incurable due to aggravation of sannipata.

Ci30#190
<!-- Page 279 -->

## PRADARA (UTERINE MENORRHAGIA):

 Diagnosis Etiology Symptoms Signs of Normal Menstrual Flow

 Treatment General Treatment
<!-- Page 282 -->

"Menorrhagia has been said earlier."

Synonyms for Pradara:

 "The experts of the treatise named it as 'asrgdara' because menstrual flow is increased and discharged excessively."

Ci30#208

Symptoms of Menorrhagia:

Menstrual flow is increased and discharged excessively.

Ci30#208

Cause of Menorrhagia:

 Taking excessively salty, sour, heavy, pungent, burning and fatty things, fatty meat of domestic and aquatic animals, krsara (rice cooked with pulse), payasa (rice cooked with milk), curd, sukta (vinegar), curd water, wine etc. V gets vitiated and blood also crosses its limit of quantity. - Ci30#205-206

 Such V reaching the menses-caryying vessels in uterus takes along the blood and increases the quantity of menstrual flow thereby.

Ci30#207

The 4Types of Pradara:

V

P

K

Sannipata

Ci30#209

Cause of V pradara:

When V is vitiated due to intake of rough things etc. " and taking along rakta".

Ci30#211

Symptoms of V pradara:

 The menstrual discharge is frothy, thin, rough, blackish, reddish, "stimulating" [simulating [" which looks like" ] water of palasa flowers;

may be with or without pain;

there is intense pain in waist, groin, cardiac region, sides, back and pelvis.

Ci30#212-215

Cause of P Pradara:

 When P vitiated by intake of sour, hot, salty and alkaline things cause pradara in the above way.

Ci30#216

Symptoms of P Pradara:

The menstrual discharge is bluish, yellow, very hot, black or deep red;

 discharge is frequent and painful, associated with burning sensation, redness, thirst, mental confusion, fever and giddiness.

Ci30#218-219

Cause of K Pradara:

When K is vitiated by intake of heavy things etc. it causes K pradara.

Ci30#220

Symptoms of K pradara:

 Menstrual blood flows out as slimy, pale, heavy, unctuous, cold, and viscous with mild pain.
<!-- Page 283 -->

This is associated with vomiting, anorexia, nausea, dyspnea and cough. Ci30#221

Cause And Symptoms of Sannipata Asrgdara:

 When a woman exceedingly ill and anemic indulges in all the etiological factors, intensely aggravated V pushes out K with attenuated strength and burnt with the heat of P through the passage of blood (vagina) as fetid, slimy and yellow.

 When it [V?/ menstrual flow?]carries away with force muscle-fat and fat and passes out constantly through vagina discharge simulating ghee, marrow and muscle-fat and she herself is anemic, weak and associated with thirst, burning sensation and fever, this is sannipatika type.

Prognosis: This is incurable.

Ci30#222-224

## Signs of Normal Menstrual Flow:

Menstrual flow should be taken as normal which:

Comes forth monthly.

Is free from sliminess, burning sensation or pain.

Stays for 5 days duration.

Has neither excessive nor insufficient quantity.

Has color similar to gunja fruit (seed), red lotus flower, lac juice and indragopaka (a red insect).

Ci30#225-226

## General Treatment for Pradara:

 Whatever treatment is prescribed for the types of the disorders of female genital track such as vatala etc. should be given wholly in 4 types of pradara.

 Treatment as prescribed for raktatisara (bloody diarrhea), raktapitta (internal hemorrhage) and raktarsa (bleeding piles) should be given.

Ci29#154

 The above treatment [referring to just the single formula above] should be applied by one conversant in reasoning and variation after considering specific positions and strength or otherwise of dosas. [The above formula might aggravate a pure V type or pure P type pain.]

Ci29#155

Treatment of V vitiated due to Blockage of Passage by Excessive aggravation of Medas and K:

 Unction and bulk-promoting measures should not be applied in the beginning. Instead, K and medas should be diminished with physical exercises, evacuation, intake of arista and urine, purgation and administration of buttermilk and haritaki.

Ci29#156-157

 One should take decoction of aswattha with honey. It overcomes shortly even the severe vatarakta caused by 3 doshas [together].

## Fainting and Coma

Diagnosis

Etiology Narcosis- Symptoms Fainting- Symptoms Coma- Symptoms

 Treatment Treatment of Coma Treatment of Fainting and Narcosis
<!-- Page 303 -->

[*Note: this chapter was originally in the Charaka with the chapter on blood disorders, so it should be considered as related. One may with to refer to that "Blood" chapter for more background concepts.*]

 When in a person indulged in dirty food and having himself covered with rajas and tamas, the vitiated dosas, singly or in combination, obstruct the channels carrying rakta, rasa and consciousness and are located there, they give rise to diseases– "mada" (narcosis) [Note: not "unmada" (insanity)], "murchha" (fainting) and "samnyasa" (coma). Su24#25-29 [Note: P.V. Sharma has spelled the sanskrit word for fainting alternately as "murchha" or "murccha".]

## Mada (narcosis):

 The person should be diagnosed as a case of V-type mada, if his speech is adherent, excessive and fast, movement is unstable and falling, and face is rough, reddish or blackish.

 The person with angry and harsh speech, inclination towards beating and quarrels, and red, yellow and black face should be known as a case of P-type mada.

 The person affected with K-type mada has little and incoherent speech, drowsiness and lassitude, paleness and continued concentration.

 In sannipatika-type mada, all these features are found. Su24#30-32

 This narcosis arises and subsides quickly like the alcoholic narcosis. Su24#33

 All types of narcosis– caused by alcoholic drinks, poisons or blood– do not occur except by the vitiation of the 3 dosas V, P and K.

Su24#34

## Murchha (fainting):

 In V-type murchha (fainting), the patient becomes unconscious seeing the sky as blue, black or reddish and recovers quickly. Other symptoms are trembling, body-ache, excessive pain in cardiac region, emaciation, blackish and reddish lustre.

 In P-type murchha, unconsciousness comes after seeing the sky as red, green or yellow and recovery is with sweating. There are also symptoms like thirst, pyrexia, red or yellow disturbed eyes, loose motions and yellow face.

 The patient of K-type murchha, gets unconscious after seeing the sky like clouds or covered with deep darkness and recovers after a long time. He feels his body parts heavy and as wrapped with wet hide. He also suffers from excessive salivation and nausea.

 Sannipata-type murchha has got the characters of all the above types and attacks in paroxysm like epilepsy with the difference that in this (murchha)\_ the patient falls down without disgusting movement.
<!-- Page 304 -->

## Samnyasa (coma):

 Mada and murccha subside on their own accord when the dosas finish their attack but samnyasa (coma) does not subside without medicines.

 In weak persons, when very strong dosas get located in the abode of vital breath (heart) and affect the movement of speech, body and mind, coma ensues. The person affected with coma looks stick-like and as dead and immediately succumbs to death if the emergency is not managed quickly. As a wise person brings out the utensil drowning in deep water quickly before it settles down to the bottom of the ocean, the physician should manage the patient suffering from coma [expediently].

Su24#42-46

## Treatment of Samnyasa (coma):

 For arousing him from the deep slumber, collyriums, drops, smokes, blowing, needling, burning, pain in nail bed, plucking the hairs of head and body, biting with teeth, rubbing with hairy fruits of atmagupta are useful. Besides, various types of strong alcoholic liquors added with plenty of pungent substances should be poured into his mouth frequently. Similarly, the juice of matulunga added with dry ginger and sauvarcala salt combined with hingu along with wine, sour juice or vinegar should be administered for arousing consciousness.

 When the patient regains consciousness he should be given light diet and during this period he should be entertained with surprising narratives, memoirs, pleasing talks, enchanting songs and playing of musical instruments and colorful scenery [to keep him from falling back into coma]. Moreover, he should be treated with purgation, emesis, smoking, collyrium, gargles blood-letting and rubbing all over the body. Thus his mind should be protected well from the causes of desctruction.

Su24#47-53

## Treatment of Murchha and Mada:

 In murchha and mada, the patients should be subjected to the 5 evacuative measures, after they have been uncted and fomented properly, according to disorder and strength. Likewise, the administration of paniya-kalyana ghrta (having 28 drugs), tikta satpala ghrta or mahatikta ghrta is recommended. The use of triphala with ghee, honey and sugar; silajatu, milk, pippali or citraka with milk, rasayana drugs or kaumbha (10 year old) ghee is also beneficial.

 Mada and murchha are alleviated by blood letting and constantly keeping in touch with scriptures, noble and strong-minded persons.

Punarvasu, the father-like savior of all beings, master of the past and the present and the best among the professors described the successful treatment to alleviate gulma (abdominal lump).

Ci5#3

# the 5 Types of Gulma:

 Vatagulma, Pittagulma, Kaphagulma, Nicaya (sannipatika) gulma and Sonita (rakta) gulma

Ni3#3

### Knowledge of specific characters:

 Specific characters of all diseases are defined on the basis of etiology, prodroma, symptoms, chief complaint and therapeutic suitability.

Ni3#5

# Etiology of Gulma:

 V gets vitiated in the belly due to excessive discharge of feces, K and P or due to compression [of feces] because of their excessive accumulation or because of suppression of impelled downward urges or external injury or excessive pressure or excessive intake of rough food and drinks or grief or faulty application of evacuative measures or uneven and excessive movements. Ci5#4-5

# Pathology, Symptoms, Means of Diagnosis, and Types of Gulma:

 That vitiated V aggravates K and P and obstructing the passages through them [V, pushing P and K, obstructs the passages] produces pain in cardiac region, navel, sides, abdomen and pelvis and does not move downwards due to blocking of the passage, thus located in pakvasaya (colon), pittasaya or kaphasaya, independent or dependent, known by palpation, acquires the name of gulma (lump) due to its lumpy nature according to dosa.

Ci5#6-7

#### 5 Sites of Gulma:

 "pelvic region, umbilical region, cardiac region or flanks." [yes, that's only 4 listed.]

Ci5#8

### Etiology of V Gulma:

 Rough food and drinks, uneven and excessive activities, suppression of urges, anxiety, injury, excessive loss of excrements and fasting

Ci5#10

#### Etiology of V-type gulma:

 when a person of V constitution who is particularly emaciated doe to one of the reducing factors like fever, emesis, purgation and diarrhea takes V-aggravating food, or excessive quantity of food

 or is administered emesis or purgation without prior unction, propels unimpelled vomiting,

holds up impelled urges of flatus, urine, feces,
<!-- Page 307 -->

or takes fresh water too much after a heavy meal or travels by an excessively jerking vehicle,

 indulges in excessive sexual intercourse, physical exercise, alcoholic drinks and anxiety,

 is subjected to injury, or uses uneven postures in sitting, sleeping, standing and walking,

 or starts some other similar complicated and excessive physical exercise, ...by such unwholesome act of his, V gets vitiated.

Ni3#6

### Pathology of V-type Gulma:

 That vitiated V on having entered into the mahasrotas (G.I. tract), hardens due to roughness and being formed into a mass is localized in the region of the heart, urinary bladder, sides and [or] navel.

Ni3#7

### Symptoms of V Gulma:

 The gulma which shows wide variations of location, symptoms and pain, causes obstruction in feces and flatus, dryness in throat and mouth, blackish and reddish complexion, fever with shivering, pain in heart, abdomen, sides, shoulders and head, aggravates in empty stomach and becomes mild on taking food should be taken as caused by V. In this case, rough, astringent, bitter and pungent food articles do not suit.

Ci5#11

## Symptoms of V-type Gulma:

 It causes pain and nodules of various types, remains massified, because of massification, it is called gulma (that which forms a bolus).

 It sometimes aggravates, sometimes is diminished, having unstable severe and mild pain due to instability of V, sometimes there is a sensation of ants crawling in the organs [body parts], frequency of various types of pain such as piercing, breaking, twitching, extension, contraction, numbness, oversensitivity, the patient feels himself as having been pierced with needle or nail, rise of temperature in the evening, dryness of mouth respiratory trouble, horripilation at the onset of pain;

 occurrence of complicatons such as spleen (enlargement), distension and gurgling sound in abdomen, indigestion, udavarta (upward movement of V), body-ach3e, pain in sternomastoid, head and temples and Bradhna (swelling of inguinal glands), appearance of blackness, reddishness and roughness in skin, nails, eyes, face, urine and feces, unsuitability of the etiological factors and suitability of the contrary ones. This is vatagulma.

Ni3#7

### Etiology of P Gulma:

 Excessive intake of pungent, sour, irritant, hot, burning, rough substances, anger, wine, the sun and the fire; ama dosa, injury and impure blood.

Ci5#12

# Etiology of P-type Gulma:

 If a person emaciated due to the same reducing factors uses sour, salty, pungent, alkaline, hot and sharp things, vinegar, damaged wine, salads and sour fruits and also
<!-- Page 308 -->

acid-producing vegetables, grains, meat, etc; takes food during indigestion, is administered emesis when amasaya (stomach) is quite rough, suppresses natural urges for long, and is exposed excessively to the sun and the wind, his P along with V gets vitiated.

Ni3#8

Pathology and Symptoms of P-type Gulma:

 V collecting the vitiated P in a portion of amasaya produces the same types of pain as said in vatagulma.

 Due to P, the patient feels burning sensation (with hyperacidity) in the belly, cardiac region, chest and throat, and at the same time he emits out smoky and sour eructations; in the location of gulma there is heat, burning and heating pain, sweating and moistening, laxity, tenderness and slight horripilation;

 he is afflicted with complications such as: fever, giddiness, burning pain, thirst; dryness of throat, palate and mouth, fainting and diarrhea; has green or yellow skin, nails, eye, face, urine and feces; etiological factors as mentioned above are unsuitable to him and the contrary ones are suitable. This is Pitta gulma.

Ni3#9

#### Symptoms of P Gulma:

 Fever, thirst, reddishness of face and body, pain aggravating during digestion of food, sweating, burning, tenderness as in abscess.

Ci5#13

#### Etiology of K Gulma:

 Cold, heavy, unctuous food, lack of movement, over-saturation, excessive sleep in day.

Ci5#14

# Etiology of K-type Gulma:

 If a person emaciated due to the aforesaid reducing factors, takes too much unctuous, heavy, sweet and cold things, habitually takes preparations of (rice) flour, sugarcane, milk, sesamum, black gram and jaggery; uses excessively immature curd and wines, indulges in salads, overeats meat of marshy, aquatic and domestic animals, suppresses natural urges, while hungry takes too much water or is subjected to jerking of the body, his K along with V gets vitiated.

Ni3#10

# Pathology of K-type Gulma:

 V accumulating that vitiated K in a portion of amasaya gives rise to various types of pain as mentioned in Vatagulma.

Ni3#11

#### Symptoms of K Gulma:

 Feeling of weakness, cold fever, malaise, nausea, cough, anorexia, heaviness, coldness, mild pain, hardness with elevation [locally of the abdominal lump].

Ci5#15

# Symptoms of K-type Gulma:

various types of pain as mentioned in Vatagulma

 particularly K causes fever with initial cold, anorexia, indigestion, bodyache, horripilation, heart disease, vomiting, sleep, lassitude, cold sensation, heaviness and distress in head; in gulma, there is stability, heaviness, hardness, deepness and numbness;
<!-- Page 309 -->

complications such as cough, dyspnea and coryza and even phthisis in much advanced stage, whiteness in skin, nails, eye, face, urine and feces, unsuitability of the etiological factors and suitability of the contrary ones. Thus Kaphagulma.

Ni3#11

# Etiology of Dwidosaja and Sannipatika Gulma:

All of the above factors are causative. 3 dosas = 3 doshic involvement.

 When the etiology and symptoms of 2 dosas are found, the dosa is taken as caused by 2 dosas.

 Treatment of sannipatika should observe relative severity of involved doshas. Ci5#16

## The Tri-doshic, Incurable Gulma:

 Gulma which has intense pain, burning, stony hard and elevated, quickly inflaming, severe and which takes away the strength, body and agni is taken as caused by 3 dosas. This is incurable.

Ci5#17

## Sannipatika Gulma:

 In case of the combination of etiology and symptoms of 3 doshas, it is said as sannipatika gulma by the experts.

 This is incurable due to mutually conflicting of the therapeutic measures. Ni3#12

## Raktagulma:

 Rakta gulma is a condition of the uterus, appearing only in women, related to menstrual flow.

Ni3#13

### Etiology of Raktagulma:

 In women who suppress the impending natural urges because of dependence, want of wisdom or constant attendance to others,

 or use of V-aggravating things after abortion, delivery or during menses, ...thus V gets vitiated. Ni3#13

### Pathology of Raktagulma:

 this vitiated V, having entered into the mouth of the uterus, checks the menstrual flow. -#14

In every month the menstrual blood being checked enlarges the abdomen.

 The patient, consequently suffers from pain, cough, diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, indigestion, bodyache, sleep, lassitude, cold sensation and excessive salivation.

 There is also milk in the breasts, blackness in lips and breasts, excessive malaise in eyes, fainting, nausea, longing for certain things, swelling in feet, slight appearance of line of small hairs, dilatation of vagina along with foul smell and discharge (all symptoms of pregnancy);

 there is pulsation in the entire mass of gulma (instead of movement of body parts of fetus), but the confused ones take her as pregnant although she is not so.

Ni3#14
<!-- Page 310 -->

## Prodromal Symptoms of All 5 Types of Gulma:

 aversion to food, anorexia, indigestion, irregularity of digestion, hyperacidity, vomiting and eructation unusually during digestion, non-emergence of urges for flatus, urine and feces or non-elimination or slight elimination if emerged, pain, distension, gurgling sound, malaise and diarrhea due to V, loss of appetite, debility, 'intolerance to food saturation' [intolerance to heavy, fatty food].

Ni3#15

## Role of V in Gulma:

 Out of all the types of gulma, no gulma arises without V. Ni3#16

## Uterine Gulmas:

 Gulma originated from (accumulation of menstrual) blood in women is caused by fasting during the period of menses, fever, roughening, suppression of urges, astringents, emetics and other uterine disorders.

Ci5#18

 That lump which pulses lately only as a lump and not with limbs, has pain and symptoms similar to those of pregnancy is taken as the gulma caused by (menstrual) blood and occurring only in women. This should be treated only after the 10th month has passed.

Ci5#19

## Treatment of Gulma:

Prognosis and Treatment of Gulma:

Sannipatika is incurable, so should not be treated.

 Management of a gulma caused by one dosha [plus V] should be treated by managing that dosha.

 Management of a gulma caused by combined doshas should be managed by 'general treatment'.

Ni3#16

 Whatever is 'non-contrary' may also be administered according to the severity or mildness of complications.

Ni3#16

 The severe complications should be treated quickly and the other complications may be treated later on.

Ni3#16
<!-- Page 311 -->

When a physician in a hurry is unable to distinguish the types of gulma and in emergency conditions he should administer the therapeutic measures as prescribed for V such as proper application of V-alleviating unction and fomentation, unctuous and mild purgation and enema and amla, lavana and madhura rasas.

 \*\* Because when V gets pacified the other dosa can also be controlled even with a little effort.

Ni3#16

'Here is the verse'-

 In case of gulma, pacification of V should be done properly with all means because after V is won over, even the small remedy alleviates the other aggravated doshas.

Ni3#17

## General Treatment of V Gulma:

The V gulma which is caused by rough articles and exercise and has intense pain with obstruction in feces and flatus should be managed, at first, with unction.

 The patient should be uncted with food, massage, drinks and enema- nonunctuous as well as unctuous-.

Then the physician should apply fomentation for alleviation of the gulma.

 The application of fomentation in the uncted patient softens the channels, overcomes the aggravated V, breaks down the obstruction (constipation) and thus alleviates the gulma.

 Intake of uncting substances is wholesome particularly in the gulma situated in the epigastric region.

Enema is particularly efficacious in the gulma situated in the colon.

 Both intake of uncting substance and enema are effective/ must be used together for treating gulma located in jathara (umbilical region and sides).

 In V gulma when digestive fire is kindled but flatus and feces are constipated, fatty, hot and bulk-promoting diet should be used.

 In V gulma, the intake of uncting substances as well as non-unctuous and unctuous enema should be used now and again protecting the status of K and P.

Ci5#20-26

## Management of V Gulma with Alterations/ Complications:

 If on V having been overcome, or during it's treatment K, P or rakta gets aggravated, the case should be managed according to predominance of dosa protecting the condition of V althrough.

Ci5#27-28

Treatment of condition where, in V gulma aggravated K subdues digestive fire and thus produces anorexia, nausea, heaviness and drowsiness:

Emesis should be induced.

Ci5#29

Treatment when there is pain, hardness in bowels and constipation in the gulma having predominance of V and K:

Suppositories, pills and powders alleviating K and V are wholesome.

Ci5#30

## Treatment of V gulma where aggravated P produces burning sensation:

It should be purged with fatty and carminative drugs.
<!-- Page 312 -->

Ci5#31

Treatment of gulma which does not subside even on applying proper treatment for the involved doshas:

It is pacified by blood-letting.

Ci5#32

Treatment of P Gulma:

Treatment of P gulma which has arisen due to fatty and hot substances:

Purgation is done. - Ci5#33

### Treatment of P gulma due to rough and hot excess:

Ghee is an excellent remedy.

Ci5#33

## Treatment of P or P gulma situated in pakvasaya (colon):

 It should be eliminated in time quickly with milk enemas containing bitter drugs or the patient should be purged with lukewarm milk containing bitter drugs or ghee cooked with tilvaka keeping in view the strength of digestion.

Ci5#34-35

Treatment of gulma where there is also thirst, fever, burning sensation, pain, sweating, mildness of digestion and anorexia:

Blood-letting should be applied..

Ci5#36

 \*\* "On their root having been cut [is this related to the sentence directly above on blood-letting, or in general to the broad pacifying measures mentioned so far?], gulmas are not 'inflammed' [enlarged? P-aggravated?] and they subside, blood gets free from 'acidity' [this is one of the only references in Charaka about acidic blood] and in it's absence there is no pain."

Ci5#37

# Post Blood-letting Regimen:

 After eliminating the impurities (of blood) if the patient has become weak he should be consoled with saturation with the soup of wild animals.

 In case there is still some affection remaining, he should take ghee regularly. Ci5#38

# Necessity of Surgery if Blood-letting is Neglected:

 If rakta and P are aggravated and gulma gets inflamed in want of blood-letting, then surgical treatment should be performed.

Ci5#39

## Characters of Gulma Known as 'Unripe':

 It is heavy, hard in appearance, deep-seated, without abnormality in colour and stable.

Ci5#40

### Characters of Gulma Which is "Inflamed":

 There are symptoms of burning sensation, pain, uneasiness, irritation, insomnia and restlessness.

Ci5#41

### Treatment of Inflamed Gulma:

Poultice should be applied on it.

Ci5#41

### Characters of Gulma which is "Ripened":
<!-- Page 313 -->

The gulma , which also [already] has symptoms of inflammation, is protruded outwards, is elevated evenly, is blackish with red margins, is bladder-like on palpation [soft/bulgy], remains elevated on pressure, stiffened and numbed on pressure from sides and with localized pain.

Ci5#42

### Three Stages of Gulma:

 [the gulma will pass through these 3 stages/ it should be made to pass through these 3 stages]:

 Unripe - Inflamed - Ripened Ci5#43

### Surgical Treatment of Gulma:

 "n treatment of such cases, there is jurisdiction of the physicians of the Dhanwantari school who have undergone the practical training in puncturing, cleaning and healing."

## Differentiating Signs of External Gulma Vs. Internal Gulma:

The above descriptions were primarily of external gulma.

But the same symptoms apply to internal gulma.

 The primary difference is that in internal gulma, [the gulma will be less visible/ palpatable and] there will be swelling of the cardiac region while in the external one there will be swelling in the sides [limited to the gulma itself? Or of the whole flanks?].

 Again: "This is the sign of the internal gulma too which is under the stage of ripening, particularly in the internal one there is swelling of the cardiac region while in the external one there is protrusion of the sides."

Ci5#44-45

#### "Liquefying", Movement, Resolution, and Treatment of the Gulma After Ripening:

 "The gulma, after ripening, moistens the passages [G.I. only? Others?] and goes upwards or downwards [is passed out of rectum or mouth?]."

 "In this condition when the disorder is being eliminated itself it should be watched."

 "\{In this condition} keep the patient on a wholesome diet only, to be maintained for 10 or 12 days, and protect him from any complications.

Ci5#46

### Application of [Unction/Ghee] and Evacuation Once Gulma is Liquefied [and Removed]: Thereafter intake of ghee is prescribed along with evacuation.

Ci5#47

# After-Program to Follow Evacuation:

 When the patient is evacuated properly, use of bitter ghee with honey is recommended.

Ci5#47

### Treatment of K Gulma:
<!-- Page 314 -->

#### [The General Treatment Stages for [K] Gulma:]

- 1: lightening
- 2: emesis
- 3: fomantation
- 4: kindle agni well
- 5: ghrta with pungents/ local treatment with cauterization etc.
- 6: evacuative unctuous purgative/ enema

[# ]

# Indication of Lightening Therapy:

 Use if K gulma is caused by cold, heavy and unctuous substances and the patient is not fit for emesis and is having poor digestion.

 [The text says "at first"; so in some/ all K gulma cases emesis will be done after lightening.]

Ci5#48

## Indication for Emesis:

 Use if the patient has poor digestion, mild pain, heavy and "still belly" [!], nausea and anorexia.

Ci5#49

## Management of K Gulma After Emesis and Lightening Therapy:

He should be managed with hot measures.

The diet should be processed with pungent and bitter drugs.

Ci5#50

# Treatment of Gulma Which is Hard and Elevated with Hardness of the Bowels and Constipation:

First: foment properly

Then: "thereafter it should be dissolved".

Ci5#51

#### Use of Ghee and Pungents:

 When after lightening, vomiting and fomentation, the agni is well kindled, the patient of K gulma should take ghee processed with alkali and pungents in time.

Ci5#52

#### Evacuation of the Shifted [loosened] Gulma:

 When the kaphagulma is shifted from it's location, it should be evacuated by unctuous purgatives or enema prepared from the 10 roots.

Ci5#53

## Treatment of K gulma if the digestion is poor an V is obstructed and "the locating organ is uncted":

Pills, powders and decoctions should be used for the treatment of kaphagulma.

Ci5#54

### Treatment of kaphagulma which is deep-rooted, voluminous, hard, immobile and heavy:

It should be treated with alkali, arista and cauterization.

Ci5#55

## Indications and Procedure for Use of Alkali for Gulma:
<!-- Page 315 -->

One should use alkali in gulma predominant in K after knowing the dosa, constitution, type of gulma and season and also the extent of morbidity and strength of the patient at interval of 1 day, 2 days, 3 days or after sufficient resting period "with such an expert management that the body-strength should increase while the morbidity should diminish".

The patient should take diet of meat or milk and ghee.

 Then applied alkali scrapes the sweet and unctuous K from the "locating viscera" [the visceral organ which is the site of the gulma-tumor] and "drops it down" [propels it from the g.i. track out of the body/ diminishes it's size] because of it's corrosive nature.

Ci5#56-58

## Use of Aristas in K Gulma:

 If the patient of K gulma who generally takes a fatty diet and is suited to wine has anorexia and poor digestion, aristas should be prescribed for cleansing of passages. Ci5#59

# Indications and Procedure for Use of Cauterization:

 In case the K gulma does not subside even after lightening, vomiting, fomentation, intake of ghee, purgatives, enema, pills, powders, alkali and aristas, then cauterization should be done.

Cauterization should be done with "arrow-iron" etc..

It should be done after first doing blood-letting.

 Benefits/ Mechanics: Application of fire (cauterization) pacifies K and V in gulma due to hotness and sharpness and consequently the lump of gulma vanishes.

Ci5#60-61

 Importance of Trained [surgeon]: In cauterization also there is specific role of the physicians of the Dhanwantari school; similarly in application of alkali the physicians expert in Ksaratantra (specialty of alkali therapy) have the upper hand.

<!-- Page 332 -->

## Mythical Historical Origin of Atisara:

 In the initial age, though the animals were sacrificeable in yajnas (sacrificial rites), they were actually not sacrificed, but after the sacrifice performed by Daksa when sacrificial rites were performed by the son's of Manu such as Narisyan, Nabhaga, Iksvaku, Nrga, Saryati etc. the animals began to be sacrificed with their (animal's) own permission. Still later Prsadhra started sacrificing bulls when other animals were not available for his long term sacrificial rite. On seeing this the creatures became shocked and when in this afflicted mental state and consequent loss of agni they ingested the killed bulls, it caused diarrhea due to heaviness, hotness, unsuitability and use of inauspicious thing. Thus atisara originated initially in the sacrificial rite of Prsadhra.

Ci18#4

## Etiology of V Diarrhea:

 When a person of V constitution is exposed excessively to wind, sun and physical exercise; takes rough, little or deficient food; indulges in sharp things, wine and sex and holds up the urges, V gets vitiated and agni is diminished.

Ci18#5

## Pathology of V Diarrhea:

 In this state (agni diminished, due to the above) the vitiated V carrying urine and sweat (fluids) to the colon liquefies the stool and causes diarrhea.

 In this the stool if ama (undigested) is passed as slimy, spreading, precipitating, rough, liquid, painful, with fishy odor, slight or no sound, and retention of urine and flatus.

 The retained V moves within the belly here and there with sound and pain- this is amatisara caused by V.

Ci18#5

### Symptoms of "Pakva" ("Digested") Stool Type of V Diarrhea:

In pakva (digested) stool, it is constipated, passed in little quantity with sound, pain, froth, slime and cutting pain in anus, horripilation, increased respiration, dryness of mouth, pain in waist, thigh, sacral region, knee, back and sides, anal prolapse and now and then as scabulous. Some say it is "anugrathita" (scabulous) because of stool being knotted by V.

Ci18#5

#### Etiology of P Diarrhea:

 When a person of P constitution takes sour, salty, pungent, alkaline, hot and irritant things excessively, is afflicted by constant exposure to fire, scorching sun and hot winds and psychologically stressed with anger and envy, his P gets vitiated.

## Pathology of P Diarrhea:

 In the above condition extinguishes the agni due to fluidity and then reaching the colon breaks the stool due to hotness, fluidity and laxativeness and causes diarrhea.

Ci18#6
<!-- Page 333 -->

# Symptoms of P Diarrhea:

 The patient passes stool which is yellow, green, blue, black, associated with raktapitta (internal hemorrhage) and exceedingly fetid.

 He is, at the same time, associated with thirst, burning sensation, sweating, fainting, colic pain, inflammation and suppuration in anus.

Ci18#6

# Etiology of K Diarrhea:

 When a person of slesma [K? Or 'water'?] constitution takes heavy, sweet, cold and unctuous things excessively, over-saturates himself, is free form mental work, indulges in day-sleep and is idle, his K gets vitiated.

Ci18#7

### Pathology of K Diarrhea:

 K being heavy, sweet, cold and unctuous in nature while moving down extinguishes the agni, and further due to watery nature affects the colon with excessive fluid and thus caused diarrhea.

Ci18#7

# Symptoms of K Diarrhea:

 The patient passes stool which is unctuous, white, slimy, thready, ama (undigested), heavy, fetid, mixed with mucus, with frequent colic pain, in little quantity and with tenesmus.

 He feels heaviness in abdomen, anus, pelvis and groin, has motions without knowledge, and has horripilation, nausea, oversleep, idleness, lassitude and aversion to food.

Ci18#7

### Etiology of Tridoshic Diarrhea:

 By intake of too cold, unctuous, rough, hot, heavy, coarse and hard things, irregular meals; intake of incompatible and unsuitable things, fasting, delayed meals, taking whatsoever, drinking defective wine and water, over-drinking, avoiding evacuation, irregular application and mismanagement of remedial measure, excessive exposure to fire, sun, wind and water, want of sleep or oversleep, suppression of urges, seasonal perversions, exertion not in consonance with strength, excessive fear, grief and mental agitation, or due to excessive emaciation in diseases like intestinal worms, phthisis, fever and piles in a person having deranged agni all the 3 doshas get vitiated.

Ci18#8

# Pathology of Tri-Doshic Diarrhea:

 When the 3 doshas get vitiated, they damage the agni further, and reaching the colon, they cause diarrhea.

Ci18#8

# Symptoms of Tri-Doshic Diarrhea [as well as Prognosis of \{tridoshic type diarrhea}]:

This has symptoms of all the dosas.

Ci18#8

 Besides, by affecting the 7 dhatus deeply they exhibit various colours in stool caused by the nature of dhatus and dosas.

When the dhatus are affected too much, the patient passes stool as yellow, green, blue, red like manjistha and meat-water, black, white like lard, painful or painless, all these combined together or separately, sometimes ama (undigested) and scabulous while sometimes digested, with not too much loss of flesh, blood or strength, having poor
<!-- Page 334 -->

digestion and loss of normal taste in mouth.

Such patient should be known as CURABLE WITH DIFFICULTY.

 That having stools with the following colours and other complications should be REJECTED AS INCURABLE such as like cooked blood, liver pieces, fat, meat-water, curd, ghee, marrow, oil, muscle-fat, milk and vesavara (a spicy preparation), exceedingly blue, red and black; clear like water, collyrium-like, too unctuous; green, blue and ochrecolored, variegated, turbid, slimy, thready, ama (undigested) with moony lustre, fetid, putrid and cadaverous odor, having odor of uncooked fish, attacked by flies, containing profuse discharge of necrosed tissues, passing little or no stool associated with thirst, burning sensation, fever, giddiness, feeling of darkness, hiccup and dyspnea, with excessive or no pain, prolapse and suppuration of anus, rectal folds having fallen down, open anal passage, too much wasting of strength, muscles and blood, pain in all the joints and bones, afflicted with anorexia, restlessness, delirium and fainting, sudden relief of symptoms- such a patient of diarrhea should be taken as INCURABLE.

 This is sannipatataisara (diarrhea caused by 3 doshas jointly). Ci18#9

## Treatment and Decision on Doshic Type of Diarrhea:

 If the diarrhea has not reached the stage of incurability, it should be managed with the measures according to dominance of dosha and by examining etiology, suitability and specific dosa.

Ci18#10

# Two Other Types of Diarrhea:

 Two types of diarrhea caused by fear and anxiety are psychic and exogenous [respectively].

Their symptoms are the same as those of V diarrhea.

 Treatment: V gets vitiated quickly by fear and anxiety. Hence these 2 types are treated with V-alleviating measures and psycho-therapeutic ones like producing exhilaration and consolation.

Ci18#11-12

### The 6 Types of Diarrhea:

 Thus 6 types of diarrhea are said. Ci18#13

#### Treatment of Diarrhea:

The following is the management of the curable type of diarrhea only.

#### Treatment of Amatisara:

(Treatment of Diarrhea which is caused by dosas which have accumulated due to mixing up with undigested food:)
<!-- Page 335 -->

The accumulated doshas should be eliminated.

 Further astringent measures should not be applied in the very beginning in case of amatisara (diarrhea with undigested food-matter) because the doshas held up before they have been eliminated produce a number of disorders such as dandakalasaka (a type of alasaka [indigestion] which stiffens the body), tympanitis, grahani disorder, piles, edema, anemia, splenomegaly, kustha, gulma, udararoga and fever.

 Hence one should ignore the excited and self-impelled motions or if there be any difficulty he should administer haritaki to induce it further.

 By this when the impurity is eliminated, the abdominal disorder is relieved, body recovers lightness and agni improves.

Ci18#14-17

## <u>Caution About Severity of V Upon Diminution of K in the Colon:</u>

On diminution of K, V positively aggravates in it's own place and thus suddenly kills the patient.

Hence it should be controlled quickly.

[So, after doing lightening in wasted person with K diarrhea, be especially wary of this event.]

Ci18#121

Deciding Priority of Doshic Treatment In Treating Diarrhea, [or Treatment In General]:

Then Treat P 2<sup>nd</sup>.

Then Treat K 3<sup>rd</sup>.

Or, treat the strongest of the 3 first.

<!-- Page 350 -->

O Agnivesa! Listen well about the etiology, pathogenic materials, signs and symptoms, location and treatment of leprosy and other skin disorders which are particularly damaging for the skin (including touch sensation).

Ci7#3

 Seven materials affected morbidly are the causative source of kustha such as the 3 doshas vitiated by etiological factors and the 4 dusya sariradhatus (twak, mamssa, rakta and lasika [rakta]) affected with affliction by dosas.

These 7 materials, in this way, are causative factors of 7 types of kustha.

Arising from this source they afflict the whole body.

Ni5#3

There is no kustha which is caused by vitiation of [only] one dosha.

 However, the types of kustha having similar etiological source have difference in pain, color, symptoms, effects, name and treatment according to proportional variation, association and location of doshas.

 Thus it is of 7 types, 18 types or innumerable variations in disorders except in case of incurable ones.

 Considering the exhaustiveness of variations (of dosas) and resultant disorders I shall describe only the 7 types of kustha.

Ni5#4

 In case of vitiation of 3 doshas and affection therewith of the 4 dusyas (twak etc.), if V is predominant kapalakustha arises.

In predominance of P, 'Audumara' arises.

In predominance of K, Mandalakkustha arises.

In V-P, Rsyajihva arises.

In P-K, Pundarika arises.

In K-V, Sidhmakustha arises.

In Sannipatika, Kakanaka arises.

Ni5#5

 These 7-fold disorders, in view of comparative and superlative degrees in etiological source attains a larger number of variations of the disorders.

Ni5#5

## Etiology of Skin Disorders:

The following people fall prey to skin disorders:

 who habitually take incompatible food items and incompatible food liquids who habitually take unctuous and heavy substances

who suppress the natural urges (particularly of vomiting)

 who are exposed to physical exercise and/or intense heat after eating excessively who use cold, hot, lightening measures and diet against the prescribed order who apply cold water immediately after intense exposure to the sun, exertion or

fear

 who take food during indigestion and when the previous meal is not properly digested

 who use contra-indicated items while undergoing pancakarma therapy who use excessively new cereals

who use curd, fish, salt and sour substances
<!-- Page 351 -->

who indulge in eating black gram, radish (rice) flour preparations, sesame, milk and jaggery

who have intercourse during indigestion

who sleep regularly during the day

who insult the Brahmanas, teachers (and other respectable persons)

who indulge in sinful activities.

Ci7#4-8

## Etiology of Kusthas in General:

 In person who uses cold and hot things in contradictory and disorderly manner and also the saturating and desaturating food in contradictory way,

 takes honey, phanita, fish, lakuca, radish and kakamaci constantly, excessively and during indigestion;

 cilacima (a type of fish) with milk, diet consisting mostly of cereals like hayanaka, cinaka, uddalaka and kodo (all inferior grains) combined with milk, curd, butter milk, kola (jujube), horse gram, black gram and oils of linseed and kusumbha; after taking these in excessive quantityindulges in sexual intercourse, physical exercise and intense heat; dips in cold water suddenly after affliction with fear, exertion and intense heat;

 without vomiting the burnt (excessively acid) food again takes food of similar nature, suppresses the urge of vomiting, applies too much unction, the 3 doshas are vitiated simultaneously and the 4 dusyas (twak etc.) attain laxity.

 Thus the vitiated doshas getting accommodation in those tissues and staying therein affect those twak etc. morbidly and thus give rise to kusthas.

## The 7 Pathogenic Materials of Skin Disorders:

 the 3 doshas [[+ sannipata]] + skin, blood, lymph [rasa?] Ci7#9

# Multi-Doshic Nature of Skin Disorders:

No skin disorder is caused by a single dosha.

Ci7#10

## Categories of Skin Disorders:

 There are 7 types of Leprosy proper, and 11 types of other skin diseases. Ci7#10

## Prodromal Symptoms of Kustha [leprosy/ general skin disease]:

 loss of touch sensation excessive or no perspiration deranged complexion appearance of rashes, horripilation, itching, piercing pain, exertion, exhaustion, excessive pain in wounds
<!-- Page 352 -->

wounds appear quickly [easily/ frequently] and heal slowly burning sensation benumbed organs [i.e. fingers? i.e. the liver?] Ci7#11-12

## Prodromal Symptoms:

 Loss of or excessive perspiration, roughness or excessive smoothness, abnormal color, itching, piercing pain, numbness, general burning sensation, tingling sensation horripilation, coarseness, heating, smearing in body orifices, excessive pain in suppurated, burnt, bitten, broken, injured and dislocated parts, suppuration and nonhealing of even small wounds.

Ni5#7

 After this [these prodromal symptoms occur], kusthas manifest. Ni5#7.1

## Diagnosis of Predominant Dosha in Skin Disorders:

 All types of Kustha are caused by the 3 doshas together, so predominance or minimal role of each dosha must be determined from the respective symptoms (as follows).

 Doshas are inferred by the type of skin disease present (i.e., Sataru type is predominant in P and K).

Similarly, the skin disease type may be inferred by the doshas involved.

 Also the etiological factors (obtained from oral history of the patient) will indicate the consequent primary dosha involved.

Ci7#31-33

Symptoms of V-, P- and K-predominant Kusthas:

| V-predominant                                                                                                                                                | P-predominant                                                                                                                         | K-predominant                                                                                                           |

Ci7#37-38

## Prognosis:

 Here, what is incurable does not give up the incurability, however, some of the curables, sometimes transgress their curability due to unwholesome regimen.
<!-- Page 355 -->

The 6 curable ones except Kakanaka attain incurability if they are not treated or the unwholesome regimen is followed which leads them to the condition of 'abhisyanda' by doshas.

Ni5#9

 Even the curable ones when neglected give rise to maggots born in the skin, muscle, blood, lymph, slough, discharge and sweat.

 They eat up the skin etc. and dosas further affecting cause these complications separately.

 Thus, V causes blackish and reddish color, coarseness, roughness, pain, wasting, piercing pain, tremors, horripilation, contraction, exhaustion, stiffness, numbness, decay and breaking down;

P causes heat, sweat, moistening, sloughing, discharge, suppuration and redness,

 K causes whiteness, coldness, itching, immobility, heaviness, protuberance, unctuousness and plastering, maggots eat up the 4 skin etc, veins, ligaments and cartilages.

 In this condition these complications afflict the patient of kustha such as- profuse discharge, decay of body parts, falling down of body parts along with thirst, fever, diarrhea, burning sensation, debility, anorexia and indigestion.

Such types of kustha should be known as incurable.

Ni5#10

'Here are the verses'-

 The person who neglects the disease in early stage considering it as curable is regarded as if dead after a lapse of time.

 One who applies remedy properly prior to the disease or in it's early stage, enjoys happiness for long.

 As a young tree is cut with a little effort but the same requires great effort when fully grown, Likewise, the newly born disorder is cured easily while the much advanced one is cured with difficulty or becomes incurable.

Ni5#12-15
<!-- Page 356 -->

#### Treatment of Kustha:

#### General Treatment of Kustha:

### Treatment of Skin Disorders According to Predominant Dosha:

Treat the most aggravated dosha first, then treat the secondary doshas.

Ci7#39

#### Treatment of Kustha by Dosha:

In V-type: Intake of ghee

In P-type: purgation followed by blood-letting

In K-type: emesis

Ci7#39

### Emetic and Purgative Formulas:

These may be taken from the section on pharmaceuticals. (See [that chapter]).

Ci7#39

# Types of Blood-letting to be Done:

 In minor types [the 11 non-leprotic types): do scraping type of blood-letting. In minor types [the 11 non-leprotic types]: do venesection.

 [[perhaps the first one was meant to say major types; see verse 39-42]] Ci7#40

### Use of Evacuation:

The patient having plenty of dosha should be evacuated.

 One should take care of his strength, because on excessive elimination of doshas, V ruins the weak patient quickly.

Ci7#41

# The 3 Stages [at least in P-predominant Kustha]:

- 1) evacuate the bowels
- 2) do blood-letting ("the blood is let out")
- 3) intake of ghee

Ci7#41

#### Use of Ghee:

 When the bowels are evacuated and the blood is let out, intake of ghee is prescribed.

This is because in a weak patient after evacuation V takes place quickly.

Ci7#42

#### Emetics:

 The following formula should be used for Kusthas located in upper parts of the body, "when the heart is excited by doshas":

indrayava, madanaphala, madhuka, patola (leaves)

+

juice of- nimba

Ci7#43

### The following drugs are generally recommended for emesis in kustha:

sitarasa, pakwarasa (types of vinegar)

honey, madhuka

Ci7#44

# The following drugs are generally recommended for purgation in Kustha:

trivrta, danti, triphala - Ci7#45
<!-- Page 357 -->

## The following drugs are generally recommended as dissolving vehicle [the liquid portion] for purgation in Kustha:

 sauviraka, tusodaka (types of vinegar) asavas and sidhus (types of alcohols)

Ci7#45

### After-management of the Patient:

This is according to the purgation which has been done.

 Non-unctuous enema, and sometimes unctuous enema may be done after purgation.

Also, snuff and/or smoking may be done. See below:

Ci7#46

### Non-unctuous Enema used in Kustha:

This may be done after purgation.

It should be prepared from:

daruharidra, brhati, usira, patola, nimba, madana, aragvadha, indrayava,

musta

 + uncting substance Ci7#47

#### Unctuous Enema:

 this may be done after non-unctuous enema if the patient has aggravated V. The following formula may be used:

Madana, madhuka, nimba, kutaja, patola

+

 Uncting substance Ci7#48

### Snuff:

 The following snuff destroys worms, kustha and disorders of K: rock salt, danti, marica, phanijjaka, pippali, karanja (fruit), vidanga Ci7#49

### Evacuative Smoking:

The procedure is described in Sutrasthana [see daily routine].

 This alleviates worms, kustha and kilasa [what is that?] located in the head. Ci7#49

# Topical Treatment of Kustha:

 Note: the medicines applied externally exhibit quick effect after the impurity of blood is eliminated and thus the seat of morbidity is evacuated.

Ci7#53
<!-- Page 358 -->

Diseased spots which are stable, hard and patchy "should be fomented by means of a stone-slab and tubes and thereafter rubbed with a brush".

In this way, the morbidity of blood should be removed.

 Such a spot may alto be fomented with the bundle of meat of marshy and aquatic animals slightly heated and then scraped with a sharp instrument so that blood comes out or for this purpose horn or bottle gourd may also be applied.

Ci7#50-51

In case of minor disorder, the spot should be scarified or leeches should be applied for evacuation of (impure) blood.

Ci7#52

 In case where surgical interferenc3e is not fit and the spots are anaesthetic, alkali should be applied after elimination of blood and the associated dosha.

If the spot which is stony hard, rough, benumbed, stable and old, the patient should be advised to take some antipoison drug and then the spot should be anointed with some poison followed by anti-poison drug.

Ci7#54-55

 The leprotic spots which are stiff, exceedingly anaesthetic, without perspiration and itching should be rubbed with the brush of danti, trivrta, karavira, karanja or leaves of jati, arka or nimba, or some instrument or dried cowdung piece before application of an ointment.

Ci7#56-57

## General Treatment of P Kustha:

 the same measures that are used for V Kustha, but particularly elimination of K, P and (impure) blood and pacification with bitter and astringent drugs.

 Ghee processed with bitters and other external as well as internal measures alleviating raktapitta should be used here.

Ci7#58-59

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The leucoderma which has no red hairs, is thin,<br />pale, not so old and raised upwards in the middle | The leucoderma spot which is undemarcated<br />mutually, extensive, having red hairs and arisen |
| is curable.                                                                                          | since many years is not curable.                                                              |

Classification of Swelling According to Location In the Body:

- 1) whole body
- 2) half portion of the body
- 3) an organ [ or a limb/ body part] Ci12#7

Pathology of General Swelling:

 When V reaching the external channels affects K, rakta and P and becomes obstructed by them in the way, then while spreading it causes swelling with the character of protuberance.

Ci12#8

Cause of Swelling to Occur in Different Parts of the Body:

| A swelling in this part of the body: | Is caused by the doshas seated in this location: |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Swelling in upper parts              | caused by doshas seated in the chest             |
| In the lower parts                   | doshas seated in the colon                       |
| In the middle part of the body       | "doshas seated in the middle"                    |
| Swelling all over the body           | doshas located generally                         |
| Localized swelling                   | doshas located in that particular organ          |

Premonitory Symptoms of Swelling: heat distress dilatation of blood vessels

Ci12#10

Doshic Involvement in Swelling:
<!-- Page 376 -->

All swellings are caused by all 3 doshas, but in practice they are labeled by the respective dosha according to predominance of it's symptoms.

Ci12#10

General Symptoms of Swelling:

### Multi-Doshic type Shosha:

 By combination of respective causes and symptoms, dwidosaja (2-doshas) swellings occur, which are 3 in number.

Sannipatika swelling arises, which is only 1 in number. - Su18#7

Thus the total # of swelling types is 7.

Su18#7

#### Other Divisions of Swellings:

2 types: innate, exogenous

3 types: caused by V, P or K individually

4 types: caused by 3 doshas individually + 1 cause being exogenous

## General Description of Udararoga:

 "The people suffering from difficult abdominal diseases are seen as having dried mouth, emaciated organs, blown up abdomen and belly, loss of the power of digestion and ingestion, incapability in all activities, poor expression and leaving their last breath like orphans in want of proper remedy."

Ci13#4-6

## Pathology Sequence of Abdominal Diseases:

 Many diseases arise from defect of Agni (power of digestion), but Udararoga especially so.

 The defective state of agni is due to increases of malas (the excrements, urines and sweat, as well as the 3 doshas).

 In this condition of insufficient agni, if unwholesome food is taken, this food is not digested properly and leads to accumulation of dosas.

 "These accumulated dosas affect prana, agni and apana, and blocking upward and downward passages reaches the interspace between skin and muscle and blows up the abdomen [ascites]]."

Thus udararoga is produced.

Ci13#9-11

 The accumulated doshas blocking channels carrying sweat and fluid and affecting prana, agni and apana produce the abdominal diseases.

Ci13#20

## Etiological Factors for Udararoga:

 Abdominal diseases arise in persons having too much accumulated dosas indulgence in sinful activities particularly with poor state of digestion by excessive use of hot, saline, alkaline, burning, sour and poisoned food improper dietetic regimen after evacuative therapy intake of rough, antagonistic and unclean food emaciation due to splenomegaly, piles and grahaniroga improper administration of evacuative therapy neglecting treatment of these disorders roughness suppression of natural urges morbidity in channels ama dosa excessive jerking oversaturation obstruction due to piles, hairs and stool

[Prodromal] Signs and Symptoms of Udararoga:

perforation and tearing of intestines

Ci13#12-15

 loss of appetite delayed digestion of sweet, too unctuous and heavy food burning of the entire food taken (with hyper-acidity)
<!-- Page 398 -->

```
 absence of feeling of digestion or indigestion 
 intolerance to over-eating 
 slight edema on feet 
 continuous deterioration of strength 
 dyspnea even on slight physical exertion 
 abdominal enlargement 
 accumulation of feces 
 pain in pelvic region due to roughness and upward movement of V 
 increase of tympanitis 
 increasing, tearing and expansion of abdomen even on light and little food 
 appearance of streaks 
 disappearance of abdominal wrinkles 
 Ci13#16-19 
General Symptoms of Udararoga:
 tympanitis 
 gurgling sound in abdomen 
 edema on hands and feet 
 poor digestion 
 "smooth cheek" 
 emaciation 
 Ci13#21 
Types of Abdominal Diseases:
 There are 8 types: 
 1)V 
 2)P 
 3)K-type 
 4)tri-doshic type 
 5)spleen enlargement [splenomegaly] 
 6)intestinal obstruction 
 7)perforation [of intestines/organs; i.e., peritonitis with perforation] 
 8)fluid [[i.e. ascites]] 
 Ci13#22 
Etiology of V-type Udararoga: 
 V gets aggravated by rough and undernutrition, exertion, suppression of urges and 
emaciating factors (fasting etc.). 
 Ci13#23 
Pathology of V-type Udararoga:
```

 V aggravated by above etiology reaches the belly, cardiac and pelvic regions and anal passage.

 It extinguishes the agni and aggravating K gets obstructed in it's passage and thus enlarges the abdomen by residing in the inter-space between skin and muscle.

Ci13#23

Symptoms of V-type Udararoga:

 swelling in belly, hands, feet and scrotum tearing of abdomen unstable aggravation and recession
<!-- Page 399 -->

(association of) pain in belly and sides upward movement of V body-ache tearing pain in smaller joints dry cough emaciation debility anorexia indigestion heaviness in lower parts

obstruction in flatus, stool and urine

 appearance of blackish or reddish tinge in nails, eyes, face, skin, urine and stool prominence of thin and black streaks and veins on abdomen on percussion there is tympanitic sound in the abdomen

 movement of V within the abdomen in all directions with pain and sound Ci13#24-25

## Etiology of P-type Udararoga:

 Pitta gets accumulated by intake of pungent, sour, salty and very hot food items, exposure to intense fire and sun.

Ci13#26

## Pathology of P-type Udararoga:

 P aggravated by above etiological factors gets vitiated instantly and joining with V and K obstructs the passage and extinguishes digestive fire in the stomach and thus gives rise to P-type udararoga. - Ci13#26

## Signs and Symptoms of P-type Udararoga:

association of burning sensation

fever

thirst

fainting

diarrhea

giddiness

pungency in mouth

 appearance of green and yellow tinge in the nails, eyes, face, skin, urine and stool prominence of blue, yellow, deep yellow, green or coppery streaks and veins on

## the abdomen

 abdomen has burning sensation, pain, fuming, heating, sweating, moistening abdomen is soft on palpation
<!-- Page 400 -->

abdomen is prone to quick inflammation

Ci13#27-28

Etiological Factors of K-type Udararoga:

 K gets aggravated by lack of exercise, day-sleep, intake of sweet, too unctuous and slimy food, excessive use of curd, milk, meat of aquatic and marshy animals.

Ci13#29

Pathology of K-type Udararoga:

 K gets aggravated by above etiological factors and obstructs the passages, thus V having been blocked in it's passage comes out of the intestines and produces K-type udararoga. [note: K-type needs no association of P, whereas all 3 doshic types of udararoga have association of V; hence udararoga seems a condition of primarily V with poor agni inducing K/ama.]

Ci13#29

Signs and Symptoms of K-type Udararoga:

heaviness

anorexia

indigestion

body-ache

numbness

swelling in hands, feet, scrotum and thighs

nausea

sleep

cough

dyspnea

whiteness in nails, eyes, face, skin, urine and stool

prominence of white streaks and veins allover the abdomen

heavy, still, immobile and hard abdomen

Ci13#30-31

Etiological Factors of Sannipata type Udararoga:

 The 3 doshas together are aggravated if a person having poor digestion takes unwholesome, uncooked, antagonistic and heavy food, (impure substances such as) menstrual blood, hairs, feces, urine, bone, nail etc. administered by a woman, or slowacting poisons.

Ci13#32

Pathology of Sannipata type Udararoga:

the 3 doshas getting aggravated by the above etiological factors gradually accumulate in the belly and thus produces sannipataja udararoga.

Ci13#33

Signs and Symptoms of Sannipata type Udararoga:

 It exhibits all the symptoms of all the doshas, all things in nails etc., and the abdomen is also pervaded with variegated streaks and veins.

This is known as Sannipatodara

Ci13#34

Etiological Factors of Spleen-enlargement type of Udararoga:

 The etiological factors are: excessive jerking, travelling by vehicles, excessive movements, sexual intercourse, load-carrying, travelling on foot, vomiting or debility caused by some disease.
<!-- Page 401 -->

Ci13#35

Pathology of Spleen-enlargement type of Udararoga:

(As Well As Signs of Splenomegaly):

 Due to the above etiological factors, "the spleen located in the left side gets displaced from it's normal place and thus is enlarged or the blood increased (accumulated) through rasa etc. [the dhatus] also enlarge it."

The (enlarged) spleen is initially hard and like a small stony piece .

It gradually increases and becomes like a tortoise.

 If neglected, it gradually overlaps the belly, abdomen and the seat of digestive fire [stomach/solar plexus/ small intestine] and thus produces udararoga.

This type is called Plihodara.

Ci13#36

## Signs and Symptoms of Spleen-enlargement type of Udararoga:

debility

anorexia

indigestion

retention of stool and urine

unconsciousness

thirst

body-ache

vomiting

fainting

lassitude

cough

dyspnea

mild fever

hardness in bowels

loss of fire

emaciation
<!-- Page 402 -->

tastelessness in mouth tearing pain in smaller joints gas formation and pain in belly

 reddish or abnormal tinge in or appearance of blue, green or yellow streaks on abdomen

Ci13#37

Liver Enlargement:

# Etiology, Pathology and Symptoms of Liver Enlargement:

 "In the same way, liver situated in right side produces the above symptoms (when enlarged). Because of similarity in etiology, symptoms and treatment, it is included in plihodara itself."

Ci13#38

# Etiological Factors of Obstructive[ed] Abdomen Type of [caused] Udararoga:

[Clarify this term/ concept above]

 Obstruction in anal passage caused by ingestion of eye lashes, hairs etc. with meals.

Reverse peristalsis, piles or "intussuception".

Ci13#39

### Pathology of Obstructive[ed] Abdomen Type of [caused] Udararoga:

 Due to the above etiological factors, apana V, because of obstruction in passage, gets vitiated and by extinguishing (digestive) fire and causing retention of feces, retention of P and retention of K produces udararoga.

It is known as Baddhagudodara (obstructive abdomen).

Ci13#40

# Symptoms of Obstructive[ed] Abdomen Type of [caused] Udararoga:

 Thirst, burning sensation, fever, dryness of mouth and palate, weakness in thighs, cough, debility, anorexia, indigestion, retention of stool and urine, tympanitis, vomiting, sneezing;

pain in head, heart, navel and anus;

 abdomen with V confounded, immobile, having reddish tinge, "prominence of blue streaks and veins or no streaks" and often with cylindrical protrusion above umbilicus.

Ci13#41

# Etiological Factors of Perforative Abdomen Type of Udararoga:

 Perforation of the intestines due to ingestion of gravels, grass, wooden or body piece or thorn with food.

 Yawning or over-eating followed by "suppuration" of the intestines may also cause perforated intestines.

Ci13#42

# Pathology of Perforative Abdomen Type of Udararoga:
<!-- Page 403 -->

Due to the above etiological factors, the chyle is discharged out of the holes in the intestines, "and filling up the intestinal loop and anus produces udararoga".

Ci13#43

#### Symptoms of Perforative Abdomen Type of Udararoga:

[It's location is] below the umbilicus

[in terms of rate of progression] it increases gradually

[in terms of form, it] looks as in ascites

It exhibits the symptoms of dosas according to their predominance

 The patient passes stool with blood, or blue or yellow coloring, or which is slimy, having fleshy odor and ama

 The patient is attended by hiccup, dyspnea, cough, thirst, polyuria, anorexia, indigestion and debility.

This should be known as "Chidrodra" (perforative abdomen).

Ci13#44

### Etiological Factors in Fluid-In-Abdomen/ Ascites Type of Udararoga:

Excessive water intake by one having taken uncting substance

[Excessive water intake by one having] poor digestion

[Excessive water intake by one having] wasting

[Excessive water intake by one having] emaciation

Ci13#45

#### Pathology in Fluid-In-Abdomen/ Ascites Type of Udararoga:

 Due to the above etiological factors, the digestive fire gets extinguished and V gets located in kloma [define this] and K is aggravated by fluid due to obstruction in passage of channels and both contribute to accumulation of fluid from it's normal place into the abdomen.

Ci13#46

### Symptoms in Fluid-In-Abdomen/ Ascites Type of Udararoga:

loss of desire for food

thirst

discharge form anus

pain

dyspnea

cough

debility

abdomen full of streaks and veins of various colors

on palpation the abdomen has fluctuation like that in a bag full of water.

This should be known as "Udakodara" (ascites).

Ci13#47

# Progressive Stages of [*The Few Types of Udararoga Which Have Fluid*/

## Udakodara(Ascites)/ Udararoga in general]:

- 1)"In initial stage it is devoid of complications and accumulation of fluid and then itself one should treat it quickly."
- 2)If neglected, the dosas moved away from their own place and liquefied due to process of ripening moisten the joints and channels.
<!-- Page 404 -->

- 3)The sweat too is obstructed in it's passage to outward channels and thus staying obliquely adds to the same fluid.
- 4)Thus there appears "piccha" (slime)on which the abdomen becomes round, heavy, still, dull on percussion, soft on palpation, streak-less (on inspection) and concentrating on the umbilicus itself.
- 5)Thereafter fluid appears which exhibits the following signs- excessive enlargement of abdomen, disappearance of veins and feeling of fluctuation on palpation like that in a bag full of water.

[Note: consider working all following info into a "prognosis" chart. The following "complications" paragraph should be duplicated.]

Ci13#48

Complications Which Manifest In [Udakodara(Ascites)/ Udararoga in general]:

 vomiting, diarrhea, feeling of darkness, thirst, dyspnea, cough, hiccup, debility, pain in sides, anorexia, hoarseness of voice, retention of urine etc.

Such patient should be declared as incurable.

Ci13#49

Prognosis of Udararoga:

 Udararoga caused by V, P, K, spleen, sannipata and fluid are increasingly severe in progressive order (so V type is least, fluid type is most).

The Obstructive Abdomen Type is mostly fatal after a fortnight [[14 days]].

 All the types attaining fluid including the Perforative Abdomen Type are mostly fatal after a fortnight [[14 days]].

 One should reject the patient having swollen eyes, crooked private parts, moistened thin skin and loss of strength, blood, flesh and digestive power.

Ci13#50-51

 For the patient of udararoga, swelling in all the vital parts [simultaneously], dyspnea, hiccup, anorexia, thirst, fainting, vomiting and diarrhea are fatal.

 "Udararoga as a whole is often the most difficult [of all diseases] to be treated from the very start."

[It is difficult, even in the early stages to treat udararoga.]

 However it can be cured with effort if it is newly arisen, fluid-less and the patient is strong.

 That type of Udararoga which is devoid of fluid may be treated (according to strength and dusya, etc.).

Ci13#52-54, Ci13#58

Signs and Symptoms of Udararoga Devoid of Fluid:

the abdomen does not have swelling

the abdomen [is (vs. is not)] reddish, and resonant on percussion

the abdomen is "not very hevy"

[is] always with gurgling sound

full of venous network

V distending the navel and disappearing after impelling the urge
<!-- Page 405 -->

pain in heart, navel, groin, waist and anus passing hard flatus digestive fire not very mild [it has not been excessively weakened] tastelessness in mouth due to salivation scanty urine hard stool Ci13#55-58

## Treatment of Udararoga:

Treatment of "Vatodara" (V Type of Udararoga) [The following Information Also Applies To Treatment of Udararoga In General]:

- 1)V Type Udararoga- (if in a strong patient) treat at first with uncting substances.[time scale is? Earlier in the day that step 2 is done? 2 days prior? Every day for 1-4 weeks prior to step 2?]
- 2)After unction and fomentation, administer uncted purgations. [time scale is 1 action in 1 day]

 When properly done, these purgations should eliminate the dosa and cause the abdomen to recede.

- 3)Wrap the abdomen with cloth piece (bandage) so that V may not blow it up again due to want of vacuum.
- 4)Udararoga is originated by excessive accumulations of dosas and obstruction in passage of channels, hence the patient should be purged daily. [time scale is 1 action for several days]

[step 1 through 3 should be repeated every day to satisfy step 4's requirements]

 5)After he is evacuated and managed with proper diet, he should be given milk for promoting strength. [time frame is? every day after step 4? only after the last purgative in the sequence of days has been completed? toward the end of the sequence of purgatives? After purgative sequence and after lightening diet period?]

 When this purpose is served (patient is strengthened somewhat), the milk should be withdrawn gradually before it produces nausea.
<!-- Page 406 -->

Ci13#59-62

## Treatment in case of reverse peristalsis or upward movement of V:

 Agni should be stimulated by vegetable or meat soup lightly soured and salted and then again subjected to unction and fomentation followed by non-unctuous enema.

Ci13#63

Treatment in case of twitchings, convulsions and pain in joints, bone, sides, back and sacral region, retention of stool and flatus and roughness (to be used only if the patient has strong digestion):

Ci13#146

 paste of- citraka, devadaru + milk Mix the above together. Use: take this formula for 1 month.

 + 
 ghee 
 Prepare the above into a ghrta.

The following may be taken: 
 haritake 
 + 
 cow's urine

 Ci13#151 
One may take: 
 buffalow's urine 
 + 
 buffalow's milk

 trikatu

 Ci13#153 
** One may take: 
 goat's milk 
 + 
 trikatu 
 Use: take for 3 months 
 Ci13#154
```

[Note the times that each milk takes to succeed. This indicates their ratio of "roughness" quality; camel's milk is 3x rougher than goat's milk. (And goat's milk is probably 3x rougher than cow's milk). Is it possible that goat's milk has a net lightening effect, vs. building effect?

This clarification of the energetic perspective of the camel and it's products reminds me of a story Dr. Lad told of a wealthy woman he treated in India for whom the only cure was fresh urine of a camel; they air-bused a camel to her hospital for him. She must of had a condition of some acute congestion. I find it hard to believe some combination of alkalis, pungents and alcohols would not have sufficed.]

## Surgical Treatment of Udararoga:

"Now comes the operation by experienced surgeons.

 After measuring 4 fingers below the umbilicus on the left side the wise physician should incise with measured instrument.

 After opening the abdomen, the intestines should be examined for obstruction or perforation.

 By lubricating the loop he should remove the foreign bodies like hairs etc. and relieve the intestines of any obstruction due to interlocking.

 Holes of the perforated intestines should be got bitten by big ants and when they are united well the bodies of the ants should be cut and removed and restoring the intestines to their place the wound should be sutured with needles."

Ci13#184-188

## Puncture [[Aspiration]] Treatment for Udararoga with Fluid Present:

 The physician should resort to puncturing in all types of abdominal disorder associated with fluid.

 On the left side below the umbilicus he should drain the fluid with the help of a canula.

 Thereafter it should be pressed gently and the abdomen should be bandaged with a cloth piece.

\*\* In case of recession by enema, purgation etc. too the abdomen should be bandaged.[this is without/with first doing puncture.]

 After drainage of the fluid, the patient, after a little lightening, should take liquid gruel without fat and salt.

Thereafter for 6 months he should keep on a milk diet.

Thereafter for a further 3 months he should keep on a diet of liquid gruel with
<!-- Page 422 -->

milk.

 Thereafter for a further 3 months he should keep on a light diet of cereals of syamaka or koradusa with milk and without salt.

 Thus in 1 year one should overcome the abdominal disorder associated with fluid. Ci13#189-192

 After all the remedial measures one should give milk in order to maintain the limit of morbidity and strength of the patient.

 For the patients of abdominal disorder who are emaciated due to subjection to various remedial measures and wasted in respect of all dhatus, milk is wholesome nectar as gods.

## 2 types of piles:

congenital and acquired

Ci14#5

## Cause of congenital piles:

seed (sperm and ovum combined) having genetic morbidity for the anal folds

 This morbidity is also caused by the unwholesome behavior of the parents and the past deeds [of the parents/ individual/ family].

 "Congenital ones [piles] are those which manifest along with the body." [i.e., arise from the time of birth.]

Ci14#5

## Characteristic of piles:

growth of polyps

Ci14#5

## Site of piles:

 The 3 ano-rectal folds situated in the space of 5.5 fingers each at the distance of 1/3 (of the above measurement).

 Some say there are more sites of piles, such as the penis, vagina, throat, palate, mouth, nose, ear, eyelids and skin.

 These are taken broadly in the sense of fleshy growth but in the sense restricted to the context those situated in the anorectal folds are called piles.

The substratum of all the piles is fat, flesh and skin.

Ci14#6

## Characters of Congenital Piles:

Among the congenital piles, some are small and others are big.

Some are long and others are short.

Some are round and others spread unevenly.

Some are bent internally and others are bent externally.

Some are matted together and others are with opening internally.

They have colors according to the doshas involved.

Ci14#7

# Characters of the person suffering from congenital piles:

 The person afflicted with congenital piles is, from the very birth, too lean, with abnormal, complexion, exhausted, having anxious expression,

 having flatus, urine and stool which are copious as well as constipated, is susceptible to the disorders of gravel and stone [of K.D./ G.B. etc?],

is irregularly constipated and passing ripe and unripe, dry and loose stool,

 who from time to time passes stool as white [G.B. stone?], pale, green, yellow, red, reddish, thin, thick, slimy, with fleshy odor and unripe,

 having intense cutting pain in the umbilical, pelvic and inguinal regions, is afflicted with anorectal pain, dysentery, horipillation, polyuria, retention of
<!-- Page 425 -->

(urine and stool), distension of abdomen, gurgling sound in abdomen,

upward movement of V,

"plastering of heart and sense organs",

excessive and obstructed bitter and acid eructations,

the person is extremely weak, with extremely poor digestion,

having scanty semen,

irritable,

manageable with difficulty,

 often afflicted with cough, dyspnea, feeling of darkness, thirst, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, indigestion, coryza and sneezing,

with blurred vision,

having headache,

with a voice which is feeble, hoarse, depressed, mingled and broken,

having disorders of the ear,

swelling in the hands, feet, face and "orbital brim",

fever,

body-ache,

pain all over the joints and bones,

 in between afflicted with constriction in sides, belly pelvic region, heart, back and sacral regions,

 [in between what?] always thinking and too idle

 Since birth his apana V covered with piles and obstructed in it's passage moves upwards and vitiates other types of V (samana, vyana, prana and udana), as well as P and K.

 All the vitiated 5 types of V plus the vitiated P and K inflict the diseased person and produce the above disorders.

This is the description of congenital piles.

Ci14#8

## Characters of the person suffering from Acquired piles:

## [Cumulative] Etiological Factors for Acquired Piles:

 intake of heavy, sweet, cold, channel-blocking or burning food, use of antagonistic, uncooked, too little or unsuitable food, eating of meat of cow, fish, boar, buffalo, goat and sheep, constant use of decomposed, dried and fetid meat, preparations of flour, intake of rice cooked with milk intake of milk, intake of curd-scum
<!-- Page 426 -->

intake of preparations of jaggery, use of black gram soup, sugarcane juice

 oil cakes, tubers, dried vegetables, vinegars, garlic, "inspissated" milk [what's that?], solid portion of buttermilk, lotus rhizome and stalk, seeds of water lily, kaseru, srngataka, taruta, germinated or fresh [vs. aged at least 1 year] awned cereals and legumes,

uncooked raddish,

intake of heavy fruits [dates, figs, bananas, avocado...] and vegetables,

intake of pickles, salads

intake of mardaka (a dietary preparation)

intake of [animal or vegetable] fat

 intake of the head or feet [of animals], [so, these 2 must somewhat heavy/ difficult to digest]

 intake of stale, putrefied, cold and "mixed up" [what does that mean?] food, intake of immature curd and deranged wine,

 use of defective and "heavy" [how does water become heavy?] water, excessive intake of uncting substances,

 avoiding evacuation [i.e., virechana in spring, rakta moksha in fall], faulty application of enema,

 abstaining from physical exercise and [abstaining from/ indulging in?] intercourse,

occurrence of day-sleep,

 use of excessively comfortable bed, chairs and seat [causing excessive sedentary nature]

Ci14#9

## [Primary/ Immediate] Etiological Factors of Acquired Piles:

 Due to the above etiological factors, the agni gets suppressed and the excrements are accumulated in excess.

 Thereafter by sitting squatting posture and on uneven and hard seat, journey on irregularly moving vehicle or camel, excessive sexual intercourse, introducing the enema nozzle improperly, tearing in anorectal region, frequent contact of cold water, rubbing with cloth, clod, grass etc., constant and excessive straining, impelling the urge of flatus, urine and stool forcibly, suppression of impelled urges, in women by abortion, fetal pressure and difficult labor

Ci14#9

## Pathological Factors of Acquired Piles:

 Due to the above Primary Etiological factors, following some of the Cumulative Etiological factors, apana V gets vitiated and coming in contact of the down-tending accumulated excrement carries it to the ano-rectal folds.

Thus the piles manifest in the ano-rectal folds.

Ci14#9

Ci14#21-22

Involvement of Multiple Dosas:

 Piles are caused generally by *all* the 3 doshas combined, and thus the specific types are determined according to *predominance* of dosha.

Ci14#23

Involved Factors and Difficult Prognosis:
<!-- Page 430 -->

"5 types of V, P and K, 3 ano-rectal folds– all these are vitiated in the causation of piles. Hence these piles are distressing, and they are precursors to various further diseases, which afflict the whole body; the piles and the secondary diseases are very difficult to treat."

So: the "5 types"are: V, P, K, dual-doshic and tri-doshic

 the entities which become vitiated in the case of piles are: the above 5 doshatypes, plus the 3 ano-rectal folds.

 Due to the involvement of so many factors, piles are associated with pain, are difficult to cure, and frequently lead to further diseases.

Ci14#24-25

## Use of Buttermilk for Piles:

## Benefits of Buttermilk:

For piles caused by V and K there is no better remedy than buttermilk.

The piles destroyed once by buttermilk do not recur.

 Buttermilk poured on the ground eradicates even the deep-rooted grasses; needless to say it can also eradicate dry piles in persons having stimulated digestive fire.

 Rasa [dhatu] which comes forth in the channels cleared by buttermilk gives rise to corpulence, strength, complexion and pleasure.

 Buttermilk also alleviates besides piles the 100 disorders of V and K (80 disorders of V and 20 disorders of K).

 Thus there is no remedy better than buttermilk for the disorders caused by K and V.

Ci14#76-88

Use of buttermilk according to Dosa:

In V-predominant type piles: use fatty buttermilk

In K-predominant type piles: use fat-less buttermilk

Use of Buttermilk Mono-diet In Case of Extremely Poor Digestion:

 the patient should be given only buttermilk, or in the evening linctus of buttermilk prepared with flour of parched paddy [[i.e., crackers]].

After the buttermilk is digested he should be given gruel of buttermilk added with
<!-- Page 435 -->

rocksalt.

 After the gruel he should be given rice with buttermilk added with some fat and with post-meal drink of buttermilk.

 Or he should be given food with vegetable [soup] or meat soup mixed with buttermilk.

Or thereafter food with the above soup prepared with buttermilk.

Ci14#76-88

Proper Schedule for Introducing and Withdrawing Buttermilk for the Patient's Diet:

 Following this order is prescribed for attainment and maintenance of energy, improvement of the digestive power and promotion of strength, development and complexion.

"One knowing the order of time" should not withdraw the buttermilk suddenly.

The use of buttermilk should continue for 1 month.

Then it should be gradually decreased.

The decrease should be in the order followed in it's initial increase.

 During decrease of buttermilk, there should be no decrease of the other food items.

Ci14#76-88

The 3 Grades of Buttermilk:

- 1) de-fatted: useful in K condition and poorest digestive strength.

Ci14#234-242

## General:

 By using sweets and sours as well as cold and hot things alternately always keeping and eye to the condition of agni, one overcomes the disorders caused by piles.

Ci14#243

Three disorders: Piles, Diarrhea, and Grahaniroga – are often of mutual causation.

 In these severity increases if the power of digestion is diminished and they are reduced if the digestion is improved.

 Hence the power of digestion should be protected particularly in these 3 disorders.

Ci14#244-245

One should overcome piles by the use of various fried vegetables, gruels, soups, meat soups, khadas, milk and buttermilk.

Ci14#246

The patient of piles should always use diet and drugs which are carminative for the wind and promotive of digestive power.

 They should never use the substances contrary to the above and those mentioned under the etiological factors.

Ci14#247-248

## About the teacher, Punarvasu:

 Once upon a time Punarvasu, who was devoid of confusion, conceit, anger and attachment and great in knowledge and penance, described to Agnivesa the types of prameha with etiology, symptoms and treatment.

Ci6#3

### Cause of Innumerable Disorders:

 Vitiation of the 3 doshas is the cause of innumerable disorders. Ni4#3

# Manifestation of K-type Pramehas:

 When the 3 factors (nidana etc.) [1-presence of K-aggravating etiology, 2 increased K dosha and 3-vitiated dusyas (effected tissues- fat, blood plasma , etc.)] are present together in the patient, they cause immediate manifestation of K-type pramehas.

\*The primary involved dosha in [all types of] prameha is K, consisting of abundant fluid. Ni4#6

# Etiological Factors (Causes) of Prameha:

idle sitting

over-sleep

 excessive use of: curd, meat, soup of the domestic, aquatic and marshy animals and milk

 excessive use of: new cereals and drinks, products of jaggery all other K-promoting regimens

Ci6#4

'Here are the verses'-

 Prameha approaches immediately like a bird to it's nest tree the person who is greedy in eatables and has dislike for bath and walking.

 Death, in the form of prameha, takes away immediately the person who is dull in activities, over-obese, over-uncted and voracious eater.

 The person who takes food which maintains the equilibrium of dhatus and also practices various physical activities enjoys happy life.

Ni4#50-52

#### Etiology of Madhumeha (Diabetes Mellitus):

 In the person eating heavy, unctuous, sour and saline substances in excessive quantity and also the new grains and fresh drinks, having over-sleep and sedentary habit, having abstained from physical and mental work and also neglecting evacuation.

Su17#78-79

### Pathology of Madhumedha (Diabetes Mellitus):

 By the above causes, K, P, mamsa and medas aggravate excessively and they all obstruct the path of V which carries the ojas to basti (urinary passage) and thus the obstinate madhumeha arises.

Su17#80

## Symptoms of Madhumedha:
<!-- Page 458 -->

It shows the symptoms of V, P and K now and then after diminution again develops.

Su17#81

### General Pathology of Prameha:

 "Dosha produces respective types of prameha by reaching the urinary bladder and affecting the urine."

Ci6#6

### Etiology of K-type Pramehas:

 excessive quantity and prolonged use of new grains like hayanaka, yavaka, cinaka, uddalaka, naisadha, itkata, mukundaka, mahavrihi, pramodaka and sugandhaka;

 use of new legumes like harenu and black gram, meat of domesticated, marshy and aquatic animals, vegetables, sesamum paste, preparations of (rice) flour, payasa (rice cooked with milk), krsara (preparation of rice and pulse [kitchari]), vilepi (paste-like preparation of rice) and sugarcane products, milk, fresh wine, immature curd and liquids, sweets and fresh substances; abstinence from cleanliness and physical exercise, indulgence in sleep, lying down and sitting, and also other (similar) regimens producing K, fat and urine.

Ni4#5

## Dusyas (Tissues) Affected In Prameha:

 The particular dusyas involved in prameha are: abundant and non-compact medas [fat] and muscle; as well as body fluid, semen, blood, muscle-fat, marrow, 'lasika' [rakta?], rasa and ojas.

Ni4#7

#### Pathology of [K-type] Pramehas:

By combination of these 3 factors (nidana [etiology], dosha, dusya), K gets vitiated immediately because of the predominance of it's aggravating factors.

 When vitiated it spreads all over the body immediately due to laxity of the body. [-an important concept to grasp; "laxity" of tissues.]

 While spreading at first it gets mixed up with the fat because fat is abundant, noncompact and similar in properties.

While mixing up K affects it morbidly due to it's vitiation.

 Next that vitiated K associated with fat joins with body fluid and muscle because the latter are increased excessively.

 Thus affecting the muscle, it produces boils, saravika, kacchapika etc. due to sloughing of muscle because of abnormalcy.

 By affecting the body fluid, transforms it into urine and also blocks the heavy openings of the urinary tubules coming out from vanksana (urinary bladder) and basti (kidney) and associated with fat and fluid.

 Thus it (K) produces the (K-type) pramehas and leads to their stability or incurability, due to abnormalcy.

- Ni4#8

# Etiology/ Pathology of K-type of Prameha:

K causes pramehas by affecting medas (lipid metabolism), muscles and body fluid
<!-- Page 459 -->

situated in the urinary bladder.

Ci6#5

Etiology/ Pathology of P-type of Prameha:

P causes the same situation, when it is aggravated by hot things.

Ci6#5

Etiology/ Pathology of V-type of Prameha:

 V gets aggravated when the other 2 doshas have become relatively diminished. It then "draws on the dhatus in the urinary bladder and thus caused pramehas." [Agnivesha has mentioned twice in this chapter that V has been aggravated because of the diminution of the other 2 doshas. This is somewhat different from the usual concern of plain V increase.]

Ci6#5

Number and Division of Prameha Types:

There are a total of 20 types of Pramehas:

 K- has 10 types of prameha P- has 6 types of prameha V- has 4 types of prameha Ci6#7

 "Thus 24 types of prameha caused by vitiation of the 3 doshas have been described in this chapter."

Ni4#46

Prognosis of Prameha:

| Dosha | Number of Types | Prognosis    | Reason for Prognosis                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| P     | 6               | maintainable | "dissimilarity of management" [Since Prameha is<br />basically a K imbalance, treatment of P with cooling<br />therapies will prevent the underlying K from being<br />removed, and vise-versa.]                                   |
| V     | 4               | incurable    | "due to severity of complications" which typically arise<br />in the V types. [V, because of it's violent, harsh and<br />depleting nature can cause severe complications with<br />weakness which are not amenable to therapies.] |

Ci6#7

In pathogenesis of pramehas, the dosas are: K, P and V.

The dusyas are: medas, blood, semen, fluid, muscle-

fat, lasika (lymph), majja (marrw), rasa, ojas and muscles.

[Note: "dusya" I think means the substratum of the disease; the effected tissue(s). (which has been altered)]

Ci6#8

The 10 Types of K-type Pramehas:

1) the urine is watery

<sup>&</sup>quot;Doshas and Dusyas"
<!-- Page 460 -->

- 2) the urine is like sugarcane juice
- 3) the urine is viscous
- 4) the urine has solid precipitate
- 5) the urine is white
- 6) the urine contains semen
- 7) the urine is cold
- 8) the urine has a slow impulse [[takes a while to be passed/ to start urinating]]
- 9) the urine is saliva-like
- 10) the urine contains gravels

Ci6#9

## The 6 Types of P-type Pramehas:

- 1) the urine [looks] like alkali
- 2) the urine is black
- 3) the urine is blue
- 4) the urine is yellow like "haldi" [[[turmeric?]]]
- 5) the urine is red like manjistha
- 6) the urine is deep red

Ci6#10

## Classification of V-type Pramehas:

- 1) urine contains majja
- 2) urine contains ojas
- 3) urine contains vasa [what is vasika?]
- 4) urine contains lasika [what is lasika?]

Ci6#11

## Sub-types of K-type Pramehas:

 The body fluid mixed with K and fat while entering into the urinary bladder is transformed into urine and is associated with 10 properties of K in abnormal state such as: white, cold, formed, slimy, transparent, unctuous, heavy, sweet, viscous, clear and slow.

 Then it acquires the similar secondary name according to it's association with one or more of these properties.

Ni4#12-23, Ni4#10

## Prognosis of K-type Pramehas:

 These 10 types of prameha are curable because they are located in fat having similar properties, K is predominant and similarity in treatment.

Ni4#11

### Description of P-type Pramehas:

## Etiology of P-type Pramehas:

 In a person who uses hot, sour, salty, alkaline and pungent food and food during indigestion, is exposed to very intense heat of the sun and fire, exertion, anger and irregular diet, and having similar body [a P constitution], P gets vitiated immediately and by the same mechanism [described a couple pages ago- the pathology of K-type prameha] gives rise instantaneously to P-type prameha.

# The 6 Sub-types of P-type Pramehas:

 Each of their names are based on the specific properties of pitta such as: ksarameha, kalameha, nilameha, lohitameha, manjisthameha, and haridrameha.

 They are associated with 6 properties of P, which are [respectively]: alkalinity, sourness, salinity, pungency, fleshy smell, and hotness ... Ni4#24-26

## Prognosis of the P-type Pramehas:

 All these are palliable [but not curable] because of their causation by combined doshas, location in medas and contradictory treatment.

Ni4#28-35

## Etiology of V-type Pramehas:

 In the person who uses astringent, pungent, bitter, rough, light, cold, sexual intercourse, physical exercise;

 emesis, purgation, non-unctuous enema and head evacuation in excess; suppression of natural urges, fasting, injury, the sun, excitement, anxiety, excessive blood-letting, vigils and uneven body postures;

and having similar body [V constitution],

 ... V gets vitiated immediately. Ni4#36

Ni4#37, Ni4#40-45

## Prognosis of V-type Pramehas:

 these 4 types are incurable because of: great severity and contradictory treatment. Ni4#38

## Symptoms of Various Types of Pramehas:

 Prameha acquires the color, taste, touch (texture) and smell according to the respective dosha involved.

So, K prameha would be .........[fill in ]

P would be ....[fill in] And V would be ...[fill in]

## Prognosis of one type of V Prameha:

 Prameha caused by V which is associated with pain, has blackish or reddish urine and similarity with majja etc. is incurable. [What is similar to majja etc.? The discharge in the urine? ] - Ci6#12

## Prodromal Symptoms [of All Types of Pramehas]:

 The 3 doshas vitiated and about to produce pramehas exhibit these prodromal symptoms-

sweating

foul smell in the body

fleshy smell in body

slackness in the body

liking for the comfort of lying down, sitting and sleeping

frequent sleep and drowsiness
<!-- Page 464 -->

"smearing in the heart" [congestion of those blood vessels/ circulation]

dirt in the body

"smearing" in eyes, tongue and ears and body orifices

heaviness in body parts (overweight)

excessive increase of hairs and nails mating of hairs

## Complications of Prameha:

 Pramehas, on chronicity [when allowed to continue] give rise to these complications- thirst, diarrhea, fever, burning sensation, debility, anorexia, indigestion, boils due to sloughing of muscles, like alaji, vidradhi etc.

Ni4#48

## Two Classes of Prameha Patients:

 1 type: is obese and strong 1 type: is lean and weak

Ci6#15

## Treatment of Pramehas

## Treatment of Pramehas:

 Amongst them, the curable types of prameha should be treated with evacuative and pacificatory measures, as required.

Ni4#49

Treatment of the Lean and Weak Type Patient:

promotive treatment should be given

Ci6#16

Treatment of the Obese and Strong Type of Patient (having abundance of dosha):

Evacuation should be given.

Ci6#16

General Stages of Evacuative Treatment for Strong Patient of Pramehas:

- 1) unction
- 2) various formulations for evacuation (mentioned in Kalpasthanam)

(To eliminate dosha from upward -vamana- and downward -virechan-

passages )
<!-- Page 465 -->

3) saturation therapy

Ci6#16

Importance of using Saturating Therapy in cases of Prameha:

 The evacuative measures are de-saturating. By de-saturating, the patient of prameha is effected with gulma, wasting, pain in the penis and bladder and obstruction of urine.

Ci6#17

Use of Saturating measures According to Digestion:

 the measures of saturation should be applied according to the patient's digestive strength.

(Over-saturation will likely aggravate the prameha.)

Ci6#17

General Treatment of the Lean and Weak Patient of Prameha:

He should be subject to the following pacificatory measures:

mantha (churned drink)

extracts [decoctions]

 linctus [lickable paste] made of- barley powder and light edibles Ci6#18

Food for the weak patient:

 Rough food articles such as boiled barley, barley cakes, flour of parched grains and apupa (a dietary preparation)

 These should be eaten with palatable meat-soup of wild birds particularly gallinaceous birds and pecker birds.

 He should take sali rice with soup of mudga etc. and bitter vegetables added with oil of danti and ingudi or linseed and mustard.

IN cereals, he should use sastika and wild rice.

The diet should consist mainly of barley. - Ci6#19-20

In K-type prameha:

eat various preparations of barley added with honey.

 Barley grain dipped in a decoction of triphala for the whole night makes a saturation food when taken with honey.

Ci6#21

 The patient may also take them regularly mixed with vinegar for alleviation of prameha.

Ci6#22

 He should use flour of parched grains, bolus, parched grains and other various edibles made of barley impregnated with decoctions of drugs prescribed in the treatment of K prameha.

Ci6#23

 For non-vegetarians, various preparations of barley mixed with the meat of ass, horse, bull, swan and spotted deer should be prescribed.

Ci6#24

 The seeds of bamboo and wheat may also be used in forms similar to those of barley

Ci6#24

General Treatment of K Prameha:
<!-- Page 466 -->

Ci6#50

Importance of Primarily Treating Body Fluid, Fat and K:

Body fluid, fat and K are the causes of prameha.

 Therefore, the first step in treatment of K and P types of prameha should be desaturation measures.

Ci6#51

Avoidance of Etiological Factors:

the treatment of a disease starts with avoiding the etiological factors.

So, avoid the etiological factors in treatment.

Ci6#53

 [move the following paragraphs to the beginning of this Prameha chapter.] Diagnosis:

Differentiation of Prameha and Raktapitta:

 One who passes deep-yellow or bloody urine without exhibiting premonitory symptoms of prameha should be diagnosed as raktapitta instead.

Ci6#54
<!-- Page 472 -->

Differentiation of V-type Prameha and K prameha:

 If the urine is sweet, slimy and honey-like, then either of the following are possibilities:

 A) it is V-type prameha (this type is caused by diminution of the doshas) [Here the sliminess in the urine is the diminishing soft tissues exiting via the urine.]

B) is it K-type prameha (this type is due to over-saturation)

 [Here the sliminess in the urine is the excess soft doshas welling over from the blood stream into the urine.]

Ci6#55

Prognosis:

 "K and P pramehas having premonitory symptoms, and V pramehas developed by their own factors are incurable.

 The P pramehas (without premonitory symptoms) are maintainable, and if fat is not excessively affected.

Ci6#56

Prognosis of Congenital Prameha:

 congenital diabetes, or one inheriting the disease from his diabetic father is incurable because of the genetic defect.

Ci6#57

General Prognosis of "familial" [congenital/ hereditary] diseases:

they are incurable

Ci6#57

Treatment of the 7 Types of Boils which inflict the patients of Prameha:

These have been [listed/ described] in the quadruplet of diseases (Su. 17).

 They should be treated by the expert surgeons with surgical operations and with cleansing and healing remedies.

Ci6#58

Diagnosis and Treatment of the 7 Types of Diabetic Boils:

## Diabetic Boils as Complication of Madhumedha:

 If treatment of madhumedha [[or perhaps any of the pramehas]] is neglected, the 7 severe [types/ literally, 7 boils] pidakas (boils) arise in muscular areas, vital parts and joints.

Su17#82

## The 7 pidakas (boils):

saravika, kacchapika, jalini, sarsapi, vinata, vidradhi [(only 6 are listed here.

Perhaps vidradhi is counted as 2 types; internal and external).]

Su17#83-89

## The 2 Types of Vidradhi (Abscess):

- 1) external and
  - 2) internal.

 The external one: is located in skin, ligament and muscle, resembles tendon and is very painful. - Su17#90

The internal one: [[will be described below]]

## Etiology and Pathology of Vidradhi:

 By intake of **winter cereals [these presumably would be especially dry and rough, vs. heavy and damp]**, burning , hot, rough and dry food, taking antagonistic foods, eating during indigestion, 'mixed up', irregularly and unwholesome diet;

 drinking damaged and plenty of wine, suppression of urges, fatigue, complicated physical exercise and sleep, excessive weight-carrying, travelling on foot and sexual intercourse,

when dosas in body affect mamsa and rakta,

 deep-seated, painful and severe gland-like node appears in cardiac region, kloman [pancrease], liver, spleen, lumbar region, kidneys, navel, groins or urinary bladder.

Su17#91-94

 Because of having impure blood in abundance it gets quickly inflamed and that is why it is called as 'Vidradhi' (that which caaused 'vidaha'- inflammation [burning sensation]).

### Su17#101

### Symptoms of Vidradhi located in Upper Parts:

 when they ripen and burst the discharge comes out of the mouth Su17#102

# Symptoms of Vidradhi located in Lower Parts:

 when they ripen and burst, the discharge comes out of the anus Su17#102

# Symptoms of Vidradhi located in the Navel (mid-region of the abdomen):

 when they ripen and burst, the discharge comes out of both the mouth and the anus.

Su17#102

#### Prognosis of Vidradhi, by Location:

These are fatal: Those located in cardiac region, navel, urinary bladder

The Ripened ones

Those caused by tridoshas.

 All the remaining types and locations of abscess/ vidradhi are amenable to treatment if some expert and swift-handed physician is found.

Su17#103

# Treatment for Abscess/ Vidradhi:

 Hence, abscess should be treated immediately with unction and purgation because it is disastrous like recently appeared weapon, serpent, lightning and fire.

Su17#103

### Treatment for Abscess/ Vidradhi:

The teacher Punarvasu, the abode of intellect, memory, knowledge and penance, and savior of living beings, described the etiology, symptoms and treatment of insanity to Agnivesa concisely as queried.

Ci9#3

# Definition of Insanity:

Excessive wandering of intellect, mind and memory.

Ci9#8

 Insanity is defined as wandering about of mind, intellect, consciousness, knowledge, memory, inclination, manners, activities and conduct.

Ni7#5

# Etiological Factors of Insanity:

 antagonistic, defective and impure food insulting the gods, teachers or brahmanas mental shock due to gear or exhilaration difficult postures

Ci9#4

# Etiology of Insanity [doshic or non-exogenous type]:

 The 4 types caused by doshas arise shortly in persons like these such as- in timid, those with distressed mind and aggravated doshas, who use dirty, damaged, and unsuitable food items irregularly observing the rules for dieting , apply tantrika practices improperly, practice other body postures in a complicated way, are extremely emaciated, having giddiness due to intensity of (other) diseases, whose mind is inflicted by passion, anger, greed, exhilaration, fear, confusion, exhaustion, grief, anxiety, excitement etc. and in those who are frequently injured or whose mind gets damaged and intellect becomes unstable, in this state the aggravated dosas spreading to the heart and obstructing the mind-carrying channels give rise to insanity.

Ni7#4

# Pathology of Insanity:

The causative factors vitiate the doshas in the person.

 Those people with only a small proportion of Sattva (guna) are most susceptible to this.

The aggravated doshas affect hrdaya, the seat of intellect.

From the heart, the doshas reach the mind-carrying channels.

Thus the doshas quickly derange the mind of the person.

Ci9#5

### Prodromal Symptoms ('of insanity cause by doshas'):

 vacantness of head, excitement in eyes, dizziness in ears, increase in inspiration, excessive salivation, aversion to food, anorexia and indigestion, stiffness in cardiac region, meditation, exhaustion, bewilderment and excitement without occasion, constant horripilation, frequent fever, abnormalcy in mind, urticarial patches, facial expression as if affected by facial paralysis; frequent appearance in dreams of rolling, moving, unstable and inauspicious visual objects, riding over the wheel of oil press, being churned by whirl winds, drowning in a whirl of turbid waters and divergence of eyes.
<!-- Page 479 -->

Ni7#6

performance of any other inauspicious act

-thus are described the times of affliction.

Ni7#14

### Prognosis:

## Incurable type:

 One who strikes at others or himself without hesitation, raising his hands with wrath and agitation should be declared as incurable. Ci9#22

#### Rejectable Type:

One who has tearful eyes, hemorrhage from the penis, wounded tongue, running nose, "abraised skin" [abraided? Bruised?], "uncounteractable hands" [they do not respond to other persons stimuli/ restraint], constantly groaning, deranged complexion, excessive thirst and foul smell should be known as maddened by a violent one and should be rejected.

Ci9#22

# Sings of Insanity caused by Longing for Pleasure or Worship:

Those maddened by longing for pleasure or worship should be know by their liking [so just ask them].

Ci9#23

"There is 3-fold object in insaning by insanity-producing agents" [clarify the preceding], such as: violence, pleasure and worship."

 Their specific object should be known by observing the specific behavior of the insane.

 If inflicted with the violent one, the patient enters into fire, sinks into water, falls into a pit from the ground; strikes himself with weapon, whip, wooden stick, brickbats and fist; and takes other suicidal action. He should be known as incurable, while the other 2 are curable.

Ni7#15

#### Treatment:
<!-- Page 486 -->

Remedial measures for the curable 2 types are as follows:

 recitation of mantras, wearing of roots and gems, auspicious rites, offerings, gifts, oblations, religious rules, vow, propitiation, fasting, blessings, prostration, visit to religious places etc.

Ni7#16

Thus the 5 types of insanity are described. - Ni7#17

 Although 5 they are in fact 2 while being divided as innate in exogenous, and curable and in-curable.

They, however, associate with each other by combination of respective causes.

Then they have combined prodroma as well as symptoms.

 Amongst them, combination of incurable ones, and curable and incurable ones should be known as incurable while the combination of curable ones is curable. It's treatment also consists of the combination of therapeutic measures.

Ni7#18

 Neither the gods, nor the gandharvas, nor pisacas, nor raksasas, nor others inflict a person who is himself unaffected (by his own deeds).

 When these associate with the person afflicted by his own deeds, that affliction is (evidently) not caused by them nor is there any sense of accomplishment by them.

Ni7#19-20

 One should not implicate infliction from the gods, forefathers or raksasas in case of a disease caused by one's own deeds through intellectual error.

 One should regard himself as the doer of happiness and unhappiness, hence one should follow the propitious path without any fear.

 Worship of the gods etc. and use of wholesome things, the gods etc. and antagonism with them– all this depends on one's own self.

Ni7#21-23

## Treatment:

"Now I will describe in brief and in detail the treatment of both the innate and exogenous types of insanity." Ci9#24

 In these conditions, the smoking stick which has been made of aromatic substances or "sweta etc." said under evacuative smoking (see Sutrasthana chapter 5) added with hingu should be used.

Ci9#74

# Topical Treatments for V-K-type Insanity:

 Mostly in insanity caused by V and K sprinkling, collyrium, blowing, snuffing and smoking should be applied with urine, bile, feces, skin, hairs, nails and hide of porcupine, owl, cat, jackal, wolf and goat.

Ci9#75

### Treatment of P-type Insanity:

 In P type, tiktaka and jivaniya ghrta (ghee cooked with bitters and vitalizers) and "mixed fat" are efficacious.

Also, the patient should be given cold, sweet and soft food and drinks.

 Or, the physician should let out some blood from the vein situated in the joining of the temple and the end of the hair limit [hair line] in insanity, irregular fever and epilepsy.

Ci9#76-77

# Treatment of Insanity caused by Longing for Pleasure or Worship:

They should be treated with hymns and drugs mixed with the respective gifts and offerings.

Ci9#23

#### General Restrictions in Insanity:

The patient should be kept in wind-free place .

Ghee and meat should be restricted [minimal] in his diet.

 Thus by getting rid of the loss of intellect and memory he regains sense and recovers.

Ci9#78

 A friend should console him with religious and purposeful words or tell him the loss of some favorite person or thing or show him some astonishing thing.

 Or, after massaging with mustard oil he should be tied up, and lain prostate in the sun.

Or, he should be touched/ brushed with bristles of kapikacchu or heated iron rod, oil or water.

 Or, he should be tied well, and then beat with whips, and then put into a lonely room.

Thus his perturbed mind gets pacified.

He should be terrorized by a snake (who's fangs have been first removed).

He should be terrorized by a trained elephant or lion.

He should be terrorized by armed thieves or enemies.

 Or the royal servants should tie him up well and then take him out [to a deserted location] and terrorize him with threats to kill him by the king's orders.

Ci9#79-84

The fear of life is above that of [greater than] the bodily affliction and as such it
<!-- Page 494 -->

leads to pacification of the mind deranged wholly.

Ci9#84

 If loss of mind is affected due to the loss of some favorite possession, then it should be pacified by consoling and assuring him to provide a similar thing.

Ci9#85

 Insanity caused by passion, grief, fear, anger, exhilaration, envy and greed should be pacified by antagonizing them mutually. [Induce the opposite emotion.]

Ci9#86

 The physician should administer this treatment in insanity caused by spirits or doshas after examining place, age, suitability, morbidity, time and strength or otherwise. Ci9#87

### Importance to not use harsh measures in Insanity caused by gods, etc.:

 In insanity caused by gods, sage, fore-fathers or gandharvas, the wise physician should avoid irritant collyrium etc. and other harsh measures.

Instead, he should use intake of ghee and other mild medicaments.

 Moreover, worship, offerings, gifts, recitation of hymns, collyriums, pacificatory acts, sacrifices, oblations, repetition of hymn, blessings, vedic rites and expiations should be done.

One worshipping daily and sincerely the all-powerful god (Siva), the master of spirits and the lord of the world, overcomes the fear of insanity.

 Pramathas, the attendants of Rudra who moved about in the world, if worshiped, help recovery from insanity.

Ci9#88-92

### Treatment of Exogenous-type Insanity:

 It is pacified by offerings, auspicious acts, oblations, **wearing roots and antipoison drugs**, good conduct, austerity, knowledge, gifts, religious duties, vows, worship of gods, cows, brahmanas and preceptors and unfailing hymns and drugs.

Ci9#93-94

# Similarity of Treatment for Insanity and Epilepsy:

 Because of similarity in etiology and substratum or morbidity between the two, the treatment measures are also similar.

So, the treatment measures for epilepsy may be used for treating insanity also.

Ci9#95

## Measures for Prevention of Insanity:

The person who has significant sattwa nature

abstinence from meat and wine

take wholesome diet

be sincere and pure

-this person does not get innate or exogenous insanity. -#96

#### Signs of Recovery from Insanity:

as

Clarity (in perception) of sense objects and also of intellect, self and mind, as well

Normalcy of the dhatus

#### Historical/ Mythical Cause of Diseases:

 In early times during destruction of Daksa's sacrifice when the human beings fled in various directions, Epilepsy arose due to impure contact of various creatures.

Ni8#11

## Definition of Apsmara:

 It is defined as departure of memory associated with entering into darkness (unconsciousness) and loathsome appearance [[convulsions]] due to derangement of intellect and mind.

Ci10#3

 Epilepsy is defined as the transient appearance of unconsciousness with loathsome expression due to derangement of memory, intelligence and mind.

Ni8#5

Epilepsy is caused by V, P and K and the 4th one by Sannipata which is rejectable.

 The wise physicians treat the curable ones cautiously with strong evacuative measures and respective pacificatory ones.

 When there is association of exogenous factor with that caused by dosa, there the wise physicians prescribe the general treatment (suitable for it).

Ni8#12-14

### Etiological Factors of Epilepsy:

having a perverted [distorted/ disturbed] mind

 abundant morbidity due to intake of unwholesome and unclean foods infliction of the mind with rajas and tamas

 masking of the heart with doshas and injury of the mind by anxiety, passion, fear, anger, grief, agitation, etc.

Ci10#4-5

# Etiology of Epilepsy:

 Epilepsy arises shortly in such human beings as– those whose mind is disturbed by rajas and tamas, who have scattered, abnormal and plenty of dosas; use dirty, damaged and unclean eatables observing the dietetic rules improperly, apply tantrika practices improperly, practice other uneven bodily postures or due to wasting, dosas get vitiated and, in those having mind disturbed by rajas and tamas, spread over to hrdaya, the best seat of inner self, and also the seats of sense organs and stay there dominantly.

 While staying there when they are excited by (emotions such as) passion, anger, fear, greed, confusion, exhilaration, grief, anxiety, agitation, etc. and fill up the hrdaya and seats of sense organ suddenly the person is attacked by epilepsy.

Ni8#4

#### Pathology of Epilepsy:

 Due to the above factors, the doshas get carried to the heart and afflict it. Consequently the patient "suffers stupefied with wandering mind". Ci10#6

## These are the prodromal symptoms of epilepsy:

 throwing aside of eyebrows, frequent abnormal movements of eyes, hearing of sound in it's absence, excessive oozing of saliva and nasal mucus, aversion to food, anorexia, indigestion, stiffness in cardiac region, distension of abdomen, debility, tearing
<!-- Page 497 -->

pain in bones, body-ache, mental confusion, darkness before the eyes, fainting, frequent giddiness and dreams of narcosis, dancing, piercing, aching, trembling, falling etc. - Ni8#6

Immediately thereafter epilepsy arise.

Ni8#7

## Symptoms of Epilepsy:

 The patient "suffers stupefied with wandering mind". He sees non-existent things (visual hallucinations) falling down twitching of the tongue, eyes, eyebrows excessive salivation convulsions in the hands and feet after the paroxysm is over, the patient wakes as if from sleep. Ci10#7

## 4 Types of Epilepsy:

 V, P, K and Sannipatika Ni8#3, Ci10#8

## Symptoms of V-type Epilepsy:

 the patient trembles, bites his teeth, emits froth, respires excessively and sees things as rough, reddish and black.

Ci10#9

 frequent fits, regaining consciousness instantaneously, groaning sound, striking against the earth; greenish, yellowish and coppery nails, eyes, face and skin, vision of bloody, agitated, fierce, luminous and irritated objects, unsuitability of P-aggravating things and suitability of otherwise.

Ni8#7.2

# Symptoms of K-type Epilepsy:

 Delayed fits and also delayed recovery, falling down, expression not very loathsome, emitting saliva, white nails, eyes, face and skin, vision of white, heavy and unctuous objects, unsuitability of K-aggravating things and suitability of otherwise.
<!-- Page 498 -->

Ni8#7.3

## Symptoms of K-type Epilepsy:

the patient has white froth, white limbs, white face and white eyes

the patient is cold

there is horripilation [[goose-bumps]]

the patient is heavy [with ama-congestion]

the patient sees things as white

he recovers after a long period [slowly].

Ci10#11

## Symptoms of Sannipatika-type Epilepsy:

 In combination of all the symptoms, the epilepsy should be known as sannipatika which is said as incurable.

Ni8#7.4

## Symptoms of Tridoshic-type Epilepsy:

 there will be symptoms from all 3 above types Ci10#12

# A [5th, ] Exogenous Type of Epilepsy:

 Sometimes exogenous factor also becomes associated there which will be described later on .

 That can be known from the symptoms in addition to those described above and also some ones in accordance with the symptoms of doshas.

Ni8#9

## Prognosis of Epilepsy:

 Incurable types of epilepsy: tri-doshic type of epilepsy epilepsy in a wasted person epilepsy in an old person Ci10#9-12

### Cycles of Epilepsy:

 The vitiated doshas give rise to the paroxysmal fits of epilepsy at the following intervals, with a slight variation:

a fortnight [2 weeks]

12 days

1 month

[are these supposed to correspond to doshic types? Probably

not...]

Ci10#13
<!-- Page 499 -->

## Treatment of Epilepsy:

## Treatment of All Types Epilepsy:

 Beneficial for the epileptics are the strong evacuative measures, pacificatory measures according to dosas and in case of the exogenous factor mantras etc. Ni8#10

## Use of Purgations to "Awaken" the Heart and Channels:

First, one should **"awaken the heart, the channels and the mind"**.

These have been blocked by the doshas.

So, one should apply drastic emesis, etc.

V-type should be treated mostly with enema

P-type should be treated mostly with purgation

K-type should be treated mostly with emesis

So, the patient has been **"cleansed by all means".**

 Then he should be consoled well, so as to make him comfortable and at ease again.

 Then drug formulations should be administered. Ci10#14-15, 16

## The following should also be used to fumigate with:

 beaks, feathers and feces of : the mongoose, owl, cat, vulture, insects, snakes and crow.

## **"With these tested applications the heart awakens,"** the channels are cleansed **and thus the patient regains consciousness.**

[It is interesting to try to figure out– what is their understanding of how the heart is the seat of the mind, of consciousness?]

[Note: an alternate interpretation of "the heart awakens" is that it goes from \{a-systoly}; not beating, to beating once again, as in heart attack, or in severe unconsciousness. But this is probably not the intended meaning here, as syncope, with stopped heart, is discussed in another place \{chapter on 3 vital organs?}.]

"In case where there is association of exogenous factor having symptoms more than those of the dosas, one should apply remedial measures prescribed for insanity."

[So, when it appears that the cause of the epilepsy is exogenous (such as influences of curses or gods) and not particularly caused by aggravated doshas, then one should follow the treatment outlined for this under insanity.]

Ci10#51, 52, 53

Etiological Factors of "the great disease known as attachment to unreality" [epilepsy/ insanity]:

 dirty food suppressing the impelled urges using cold-hot, unctuous rough things in excess [explain this] -

Ci10#54

-55

## Pathology of "the great disease known as attachment to unreality" [epilepsy/ insanity]:

 By above causes, the doshas reaching the heart affect the channels connected with mind and intellect and get seated there in the one who is already shrouded with rajas and tamas.

Thus in masking of intellect and mind by increased rajas and tamas and bewilderment of heart by the doshas, the patient confused and having little sense interprets eternal-noneternal and wholesome-non-wholesome wrongly.

 "This is known as attachment to unreality or great disease." Ci10#56-57
<!-- Page 506 -->

## Management of "the great disease known as attachment to unreality" [epilepsy/ insanity]:

the patient should be evacuated with emesis, etc. after unction and sudation.

Thereafter, proper dietetic regimen should be given.

Give Pancagavya Ghrta + Brahmi juice.

Give samkhapuspi and other intellect-promoting rasayanas.

 Very close, trusted and favorite friends speaking about righteousness and purpose should make him devoted to understanding, perseverance, memory and concentration.

Take: oil + garlic

Take: satavari + milk

Take: brahmi juice

Take: kustha juice

Take: vaca + honey

Ci10#58-63, 64

## Prognosis of Epilepsy:

Epilepsy is treatable with difficulty.

It is of chronic nature.

It is placed firmly. [well-seated; difficult to dislodge from the body]

Ci10#65

## Importance of use of Rasayanas in Treatment of Epilepsy:

 \*\* Because epilepsy is treatable with difficulty, is of chronic nature and in placed firmly, it should be treated mainly with rasayana measures. [an interesting clue about rasayanas]

Ci10#65

## Situations which Epileptics and Insane persons should be Kept Away From:

 They should be kept away from risky situations like water, fire, tree and hills because these things can take away the life immediately.

<!-- Page 508 -->

#### Divisions of Cough Types:

there are 5 types:

 Vata, Pitta, Kapha, due to Chest Wound, and due to Wasting. Ci18#4

## Prognosis of Cough:

All of these types are fatal when they are advanced.

Ci18#4

## Prodromal Symptoms of Cough:

 the throat and mouth feel like they are covered in "awns" itching in the throat

difficulty in swallowing of food [dysphagia].

Ci18#5

#### Pathology of Cough:

 V impeded from below [Udavarta; upward-moving V; due to constipation/ alasaka] moves to the upper channels.

There, it "attains the character of Udana V" and sticks in the throat and chest.

Further, it advances to -and fills- all the orifices of the head.

Ci18#6-7

## Symptoms of Cough:

 When V fills all the orifices of the head, it produces breaking pain and jerking in the whole body.

 It particularly causes strain and stiffness in the jaws [TMJ disorder], carotid region, orbits, eye balls, back, chest and sides.

 Thus dry or phlegmy ['mucoid'?/ 'productive'] cough arises. [In other words, both/ all types of cough share this same initial pathology stages.]

"'Kasa' is so called because of producing the above movements and affliction."

Ci18#8

# Cause of Loud Cough [as in whooping cough/ croup]]:

 The cough attains specific distress [[pain]] and sound due to a specific cause which impedes V, which is forceful, thus producing sound.

Ci18#9

## Etiology of V-type Cough:

 intake of rough, cold, astringent, little and deficient food fasting excessive intercourse suppression of urges exertion

Ci18#10

## Symptoms of V-type Cough:

dry cough
<!-- Page 509 -->

the cough causes intense pain in the cardiac region, sides, chest and head hoarseness of voice dryness of chest, throat and mouth horripilation feeling of darkness "sound like that of conch or clouds" anxious expression debility irritation fainting the paroxysm diminishes after expectorating The phlegm is dry and expectorated with difficulty condition is relieved after intake of unctuous, sour, salted and hot food and drinks. After the food is digested (on empty stomach) and the wind is directed upwards, V becomes forceful. Ci18#11-13 Etiology of P-type Cough: pungent, hot, burning, sour and alkaline substances anger heat of fire and sun Ci18#14 Symptoms of P Cough: yellowness in sputum and eyes bitterness in the mouth disorder of the voice "fuming in the chest" thirst burning sensation fainting anorexia giddiness while coughing, the patient constantly sees as if stars "while coughing, he expectorates phlegm mixed with P" [[bile/ other]]. Ci18#15-16

## Etiology of K-type Cough:

 heavy, slimy, sweet and unctuous food and drink over-sleep sedentary habit Ci18#17

## Pathology of K-type Cough:

 Above factors obstruct V, and thus produce K-type cough. [So, V is still 50% of all coughs.]

## Symptoms of K-type Cough:

 loss of appetite anorexia
<!-- Page 510 -->

vomiting

coryza

excitement

heaviness

horripilation

sweetness in the mouth

moistening

malaise

the patient feels as if his chest is filled up

while coughing he expectorates profuse, sweet, unctuous and viscous phlegm.

He has no pain while coughing or expectorating.

Ci18#18-19

### Cause of Cough Due To Chest Wound:

 in a rough (undernourished) patient of urahksata (chest wound), V which has been aggravated by excessive intercourse, weight lifting and combat with horses and elephants reaches the site of the disorder and produces cough.

Ci18#20

# Symptoms of Cough Due to Chest Wound:

 In this type, initially the patient has a dry cough, but later on expels sputum with blood.

 There is intense pain in the throat and excruciating, piercing and breaking pain with tenderness in the chest.

He is afflicted with pain in the joints

there is fever, dyspnea, thirst

the voice is abnormal

when coughing, he makes a cooing sound like a pigeon does.

Ci18#21-23

# Cause of Cough Due to Wasting:

irregular meals

intake of unsuitable food

excessive intercourse

suppression of urges

Ci18#24

### Pathology of Cough Due to Wasting:

 In the person already affected with disgust [disgust of what?] and anxiety, the above causes result in loss of digestive power and produce cough.

This, in turn, leads to further wasting of the body.

Ci18#24

# Symptoms of Cough Due to Wasting:

sputum which is fetid, green, red and pus-like

 "when coughing, the patient feels as if the heart has fallen down from it's normal place"

he suddenly feels heat and cold again

the patient eats too much but is weak and emaciated

complexion of skin and face is unctuous and clean

eyes are pretty
<!-- Page 511 -->

the sole of hands and feet is smooth he is always envious and disgustful occurrence of fever of mixed characters pain in sides coryza [head cold] anorexia liquid or solid stool hoarseness of voice without any apparent cause Ci18#25-27

## Prognosis of Cough:

Cough caused by wasting, in [very] wasted patients- is fatal

Cough caused by wasting, in strong patients - is curable

Cough caused by chest wound, in a wasted person- is fatal

Cough caused by chest wound, in strong patients- is curable

 Cough caused by wasting or chest wound, which is of recent origin [less than 1 yr/ 2 months] and if the management is perfect- are sometimes curable

(Perfect management includes: 1)doctor, 2)nurse, 3)drugs and 4)patient)

 Cough in a patient of not recent origin, in a patient of old age- is "entirely maintainable"

V-type cough- is curable

P-type cough- is curable

K-type cough- is curable

 cough caused by wasting- is maintainable with wholesome management cough caused by chest wound- is maintainable with wholesome management Ci18#28-31

## Treatment of Cough:

| The rough (undernourished) patients with V-type cough:                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Treatment of Cough [due to wasting, not [Sannipata]-type]:

#### Prognosis:

 Cough having the entire picture [of symptoms] in a debilitated patient should be rejected.

 In strong patients and if the disease is newly arisen, treatment should be started, while declaring it's difficult nature.

Ci18#149

#### Treatment:

1st- administer the measures promoting body weight and digestive power.

If the patient has plenty of impurity, give unctuous and mild purgation.

The wasted patient should take evacuative ghrta cooked with aragvadha, trivrta, grape juice, decoction of tilvaka and juice of vidari (in such condition, protection of his body and strength is desirable).

 When P and K are diminished and the dhatus are wasted [they will be, both from the disease and form the purgation], take ghee cooked with karkatasrngi, milk and 2 types of bala.

Ci18#150-153

#### Treatment of discoloration of urine or dysuria:

 ghee and milk cooked with vidari, dakamba and talasasya (mastaka) should be used.

 **If the patient is non-vegetarian, first give meat of wild animals.** 

 **Then gradually give meat of quail etc. burrow-dwellers and beast or bird of prey.** 

 **These help following out of phlegm from the channels due to their hot and churning nature and thus after the channels are cleansed rasa circulating well nourishes the body properly.** 

Ci18#156-157

# Vomiting is of 5 types.

It has been described earlier in the Charaka in Sutrasthana 19 [add this in later].

Ci20#4

### The 5 Types of Vomiting:

V

P

K

Tri-doshic

Due to contact with disgusting object

Ci20#6

### Prodromal Symptoms of Vomiting:

nausea, **excessive salivation** and aversion to food.

Ci20#6

#### Etiology of V-type Vomiting:

 in a person emaciated due to physical exercise, irritant drugs, grief, illness, fear, fasting etc.

Ci20#7

### Pathology of V-type Vomiting:

 due to above etiological factors, V gets aggravated in mahasrotas (G.I. tract) and excites and throws the doshas (impure contents) upwards and thus causes vomiting due to gastric irritation .

It also produces discomfort pressing the cardiac region.

Ci20#8

## Symptoms of V-type Vomiting:

 pain in cardiac region dryness of mouth pain in head and navel cough hoarseness of voice pricking pain patient vomits with loud sound of eructation
<!-- Page 538 -->

vomit is frothy, having broken up black color, thin and astringent material patient vomits with difficulty

vomit is in little quantity

patient vomits little quantity but with severe impulse and great distress.

Ci20#9

### Etiology of P-type Vomiting:

 intake of food during indigestion and ingestion of pungent, sour, burning and hot food

Ci20#10

#### Pathology of P-type Vomiting:

 Due to the above etiological factors, P gets aggravated in the stomach and spreads through **rasayanis** (vessels) and pressing on the heart comes upwards and causes vomiting.

**\*\*[Note the word "rasayanis"-vessels; this supports the argument that "Rasayana therapy" is to clear the smaller \{blood} vessels of the body, and not so much to do direct anabolic tissue generation.]** 

Ci20**#10** 

### Symptoms of P-type Vomiting:

fainting

thirst

dryness of mouth

burning in head, palate and eyes

feeling of darkness and giddiness

patient vomits yellow, green, too hot, bitter and smoky material

vomit is accompanied with burning sensation

Ci20#11

## Etiology of K-type Vomiting:

intake of unctuous, too heavy, uncooked and burning food, oversleep, etc.

Ci20#12

# Pathology of K-type Vomiting:

 K gets aggravated by the above etiological factors, and covers [obstructs] the chest, head, heart and all vessels and thus causes vomiting.

Ci20#12

### Symptoms of K-type Vomiting:

drowsiness

sweetness in the mouth

excessive salivation

contentment

sleep

anorexia

heaviness

patient vomits unctuous, solid, sweet and white material
<!-- Page 539 -->

there is horripilation there is slight discomfort [very moderate; the least of the 3 types] Ci20#13

## Etiology of Tri-doshic-type Vomiting:

 eating all sorts of things constantly excessive defect of ama seasonal perversions Ci20#14

## Pathology of Tri-doshic Vomiting:

 due to the above etiology, all the dosas get vitiated simultaneously and thus cause tri-doshic vomiting.

Ci20#14

Ci20#15

## Symptoms of Tri-doshic-type Vomiting:

 severe pain in abdomen indigestion anorexia burning thirst dyspnea **fainting** patient vomits constantly

patient vomits salty, sour, blue, viscous, hot and red material.

## Description of a Severe V Type of Vomiting:

V gets obstructed in the channels carrying feces, sweat, urine and water.

Thus it moves upwards.

 Thus it throws up the accumulated dosas out of the belly in the person having excited dosas.

 Then the patient vomits defective material with color ad odor like those of feces and urine with severe impulse and associated with thirst, dyspnea, hiccup and distress.

Having been inflicted like this, the patient dies instantaneously.

 [So, perhaps the differentiating symptoms here are the vomiting of fecesand urine-like matter, as well as the severe impulse.]

Ci20#16-17
<!-- Page 540 -->

# Etiology of Psychological-type Vomiting:

factors inflicting psyche, such as:

 smelling, seeing or eating disgusting, antagonistic, unclean, putrefied, un-pious and loathsome objects

Ci20#18

### Prognosis of Vomiting:

 In a wasted person and which is too sever, complicated and associated with blood and pus and moon-like lustre is known as incurable.

 The vomiting which is curable and is not associated with complications should be treated.

Ci20#19

# Treatment of Vomiting:

#### General Treatment of Vomiting:

#### **All types of vomiting are caused by gastric irritation.**

So, the first step of treatment should be lightening measures.

The exception is V-type Vomiting, or after vomiting has been done intentionally to eliminate excess K or P.

Ci21#16-22

## Pathology of Visarpa:

 All of the above etiological factors vitiate the doshas, which then affects the dusyas (the effected tissues), and thus causes visarpa in those who indulge in unwholesome diet.

Ci21#22

## The 3 Types of Visarpa, according to situation:

## 1) externally situated

This is curable

 It is caused by doshas which were vitiated outwards, and thus spread outwards.

Symptoms:

 Symptoms are contrary to that for internal-type Visarpa. This "may be known by symptoms contrary to [internal-type visarpa] and also by their other specific symptoms." - Ci21#23-27
<!-- Page 550 -->

#### 2) internally situated

This is sever and very difficult to cure.

It is caused by doshas which were vitiated inwards, and thus spread

inwards.

Symptoms:

 Dis-functioning of the heart, fainting, compression of vessels, excessive thirst, irregularity in release of urges, and quick loss of digestive fire. - Ci21#23-27

#### 3) situated both externally and internally

This is incurable.

 It is caused by doshas which were vitiated outwards and inwards, and thus spread both outwards and inwards.

Symptoms:

 "The erysipelas which has all the symptoms, which has a potent etiology, difficult complications and which has effected the heart, is fatal. - Ci21#23-25, 28

## Details on V-type Visarpa:

# Etiology of V-type Visarpa:

 vitiated by rough and hot things or- covering with over-saturation Ci21#29

## Pathology of V-type:

Due to above etiology, it affects the 'dusyas' and spreads according to strength.
<!-- Page 551 -->

 the part where the disease spreads looks blackish are reddish, has swelling, intense pain with cutting, tearing, expansion, contraction, horripilation and quivering

 if not managed, it [the surface location of manifestation] gives rise to quickbursting, small, blackish or reddish eruptions, with thin clear, reddish and scanty discharge.

retention of flatus, urine and stool

the etiological factors are dis-liked/ aggravate the condition

 items contrary to the etiological factors are liked/ pacify the condition Ci21#30

# Details on P-type Visarpa:

# Etiological Factors of P-type Visarpa:

hot regimens and intake of burning and sour foods

Ci21#31

## Pathology of P-type Visarpa:

# Details on K-type Visarpa:

# Etiological Factors of K-type Visarpa:

sweet, sour, salty, fatty and heavy food.

Ci21#33

## Pathology of K-type Visarpa:

 K, aggravated by above etiology, effects the 'dusyas' and spreads all over the body slowly.

Ci21#33

 Later on big, stable, membranous, unctuous wounds with copious smearing on skin appear and re-appear.

 There is whiteness in nails, eyes, face, skin, urine and stool the etiological factors are dis-liked/ aggravate the condition items contrary to the etiological factors are liked/ pacify the condition Ci21#34

## About Agni Visarpsa (V-P-type Visarpa):

 When V and P are jointly vitiated severely by their respective causes and strengthened mutually, they spread producing burning sensation in the body.

Ci21#35

## Symptoms of V-P-type Visarpa:

the patient feels his body as scattered over by flaming charcoals

vomiting

diarrhea

fainting

burning sensation

mental confusion

fever
<!-- Page 554 -->

feeling of darkness

anorexia

breaking pain in the bones and joints

thirst

indigestion

tearing of body parts etc.

 The part where the disease spreads looks like extinguished charcoal or red and is attended by pimples as in burns.

 Due to quick-moving it reaches the heart and on affection of the heart, V becoming very strong produces tearing in the body parts and excessive unconsciousness. Besides, it causes hiccup and dyspnea and sleeplessness.

 Thus having lost his sleep and getting mental confusion and affliction he does not find solace anywhere.

 Being restless from standing he moves to sitting and then falls upon the bed, being afflicted enormously he falls asleep instantaneously and the weak one is aroused with difficulty.

Such patients should be known as afflicted with Agni Visarpa.

Ci21#35-36

Prognosis:

It is incurable.

Ci21#36

## About Kardama (K-P-type) Visarpa:

Ci21#38

#### Prognosis:

Ci21#38

# About Granthi (K-V-type) Visarpa:

# Etiology of Granthi Visarpa:

 intake of solid, heavy, hard, sweet, cold and fatty food and drinks and other channel-blocking things

avoiding physical exercise, evacuation etc

Ci21#39

### Pathology of Granthi Visarpa:

 due to the above causes, K and V get deranged, aggravated and too strong and thus damage the dusyas and cause Visarpa.

 Here V obstructed in it's passage by K disintegrates K itself in many ways [[into many directions]] and gradually gives rise to a chain of glands hardly suppurating and curable, which are in the kaphasaya (stomach).

 In the person having aggravated rakta, it effects blood and thereby produces chain of glands, which are exceedingly painful, big or small, or long, round and red, located in blood vessels, ligaments, flesh and skin.

Due to their affliction complications appear such as fever, diarrhea, cough, hiccup, dyspnea, consumption, mental confusion, abnormal complexion, anorexia, indigestion, excessive salivation, vomiting, fainting, breaking of body parts, sleep, restlessness, malaise etc., the patient associated with these complications goes beyond the reach of all remedial measures and as such is rejectable.

This is granthi visarpa.

Ci21#39

#### Symptoms (and Complications) of Granthi Visarpa:

 a chain of glands hardly suppurating and curable, which are in the kaphasaya (stomach).

In the person having aggravated rakta, it effects blood and thereby produces chain
<!-- Page 556 -->

of glands, which are exceedingly painful, big or small, or long, round and red, located in blood vessels, ligaments, flesh and skin.

Due to their affliction complications appear such as fever, diarrhea, cough, hiccup, dyspnea, consumption, mental confusion, abnormal complexion, anorexia, indigestion, excessive salivation, vomiting, fainting, breaking of body parts, sleep, restlessness, malaise etc., the patient associated with these complications goes beyond the reach of all remedial measures and as such is rejectable.

This is granthi visarpa.

Ci21#39

### Complications of Granthi Visarpa:

fever, diarrhea, cough, hiccup, dyspnea, consumption, mental confusion, abnormal complexion, anorexia, indigestion, excessive salivation, vomiting, fainting, breaking of body parts, sleep, restlessness, malaise etc., the patient associated with these complications goes beyond the reach of all remedial measures and as such is rejectable.

Ci21#39

### Prognosis of Granthi Visarpa:

The initial stage with the hardened glands only is [['hardly']] curable.

The second stage, with all the complications, is rejectable.

Ci21#39

### Definition/ Explanation of Upadrava (Complication):

 "Upadrava (complication) is the disorder itself, big or small, manif3esting in the later period of a disease and rooted in the same.

"Upadrava is so named because it appears 'after' the 'disease'."

Thus the disease is primary while the complication is secondary.

The complication is often pacified when the main disease is pacified.

 The complication inflicts greater suffering because it appears in addition to the primary disease which is already present.

Hence one should overcome the complications quickly.

Ci21#40

[Move the above to \{Diagnosis} chapter in Book I.]

### About Sannipataja (Tri-doshic) Type Visarpa:

## Etiology of Sannipataja Visarpa:

it is caused by all the etiological factors of all the doshas combined.

Ci21#41

## Symptoms of Sannipataja Visarpa:

 It has all the symptoms, spreads to all the dhatus, is quick-acting and great disastrous.

Ci21#41

# Prognosis of Sannipataja Visarpa:

It is incurable.

Ci21#41

### Prognosis of All the Visarpa Types:
<!-- Page 557 -->

V-type: curable

P-type: curable

K-type: curable

 Agni Visarpa which has not effected the heart or reached the stage of moistening of the blood vessels, ligaments and flesh: is pacified by regular treatment with general measures, but if managed with negligence any of the two [[V and K?/ Agni and Kardama types?]] can kill the patient quickly like serpent.

 Kardama Visarpa which has not effected the heart or reached the stage of moistening of the blood vessels, ligaments and flesh: is pacified by regular treatment with general measures, but if managed with negligence any of the two [[V and K?/ Agni and Kardama types?]] can kill the patient quickly like serpent.

Granthi Visarpa, before complications have arisen: treatable

 Granthi Visarpa, after complications have complications have arisen: rejectable Sannipataja Visarpa (because of it's spreading to all dhatus, quick acting and contradictory treatment): incurable

Ci21#42

## Treatment of Visarpa (Erysipelas):

## General Treatment of Visarpa:

Treatment if the disease is associated with ama and is located in kaphasthana (stomach):

 apply lightening, vomiting, use of bitters and pasting with rough and cold drugs Ci21#44

Treatment if the disease is associated with ama and is located in the pittasthana (small intestine):

 follow the above treatment, as well as/ particularly blood-letting and purgation. Ci21#45

Treatment of the disease arisen from vatasaya (colon):

roughening measures should be adopted from the very beginning.

Ci21#46

Treatment when there is only a little dosa (impurity):

use tiktaghrta (ghee cooked with bitter drugs)

Ci21#47

Treatment when there is profuse impurity in the P-type Visarpa:

use purgative

Ci21#47

Importance of Avoiding Non-Evacuating Ghrta in Patient with Profuse Impurity:

 Do not give this, because the impurity gets retained in the body, and thus causes decomposition of skin, flesh and blood.

Ci21#48

Importance of Blood-Letting in Visarpa:

The disorder is located in blood tissue.

So, first purgation and then blood-letting should be done.

Ci21#49

Ci21#97

## Description on Using External Pastes:

All these pastes should be applied for soothing.

The paste should be applied immediately after removing the old, previous paste.

 One should not wash the area in between removing the old and applying the new paste.

 In K-type Visarpa, the old paste should be removed and then washed before applying the new paste.

The paste should be thick [in K-type only].

The paste should be made of pounded drugs.

The thickness of the paste should equal 1/3 of the thumb [[width, not length]]. [that would be about 1/4" - 1/2".]

The paste should be not too oily nor too rough.

It should be not too solid [dry] nor too liquid, but of average consistency.

 The stale paste should not be applied, nor should a paste be applied more than once, because these produce moisture and pain on the diseased site due to absence of heat.

 Paste should not be applied over a bandage because that [a word is missing here... may be 'sudates' ...] the wound and consequently pimples and itching are produced.

Do not add a new paste on top of an old one, because this produces the same
<!-- Page 566 -->

defects as applying the paste over a bandage.

 Paste which is too oily or liquid does not stick to the skin, and thus doesn't work. Paste which is too thin becomes 'like a pouch' [puffing out from the skin] when it dries.

 Also, insufficiently-thick paste dries up before the active agents can reach the site of the disorder.

 Paste which is applied too dry has the same defects as insufficiently-thick paste, but even more-so.

 Paste which is devoid of unctuous substance 'exerts pressure on the site'. [Why is that? What is that?]

Ci21#98-107

## Diet for Treating Visarpa:

After lightening, intake of rough mantha (churned drink) added with honey and sugar and sweet or lightly soured with pomegranates or amalaka is wholesome.

```
 [write the above into a recipe-formula.]
```

Ci21#108

The following **mantha** should be used:

 [[a base of powdered grain for the mantha ]] paruska, mrdvika, kharjura [dates] + boiled water

Ci21#109

## Paste:

 Avalehika (paste-like rice preparation) + slight amount of fat should be taken with:

mantha of- barley + salt

When it is digested, one should take:

old sali rice

With

 soups of- green grams, lentils or bengal grams prepared with- patola and amalaka
<!-- Page 567 -->

# and un-soured or soured with- pomegranates Ci21#110-111

# Other soups:

He may also take meat soup of:

 wild animals without fat [don't add any fat to this soup/ also remove the animal fat from the soup]

+

 parusaka, amalaka draksa [grapes]

dadima [pomegranates] - Ci21#112

# Cereals:

 old red, old white and old mahasali types of rice and [old] sastika rice should be used.

 These should be 'well-drained' before use. [perhaps this refers to draining the rinse-water before frying the grains./ maybe-perhaps it refers to the growing field which should be well-drained.]

Ci21#113

### Cereals for K People:

 People who have predominance of K and are not suited to sali (rice) should be given the suitable preparations of:

Barley, wheat and sali

[So: "Sali" = "Rice".]

 [Even sali may be used for patients with K aggravation, when in the suitable format, such as fried, roasted, or parched rice-powder in soup.]

Ci21#114

### Food to Avoid:

that which causes burning

 antagonistic foods Ci21#115

# Activities and Entities to Avoid:

Ci21#115

### Further Summary of Treatment and Potpourri of Treatments:

### The measures for P should be predominantly:

cold

Ci21#116

### The measures for K should be predominantly:

rough

Ci21#116

### The measures for V should be predominantly:

unctuous
<!-- Page 568 -->

Ci21#116

Treatment of Agni Visarpa [V-P-type]: give measures which pacify V and P.

Ci21#117

Treatment of Kardama Visarpa [K-P-type]: give measures pacifying K and P.

Ci21#117

## Treatment of Granthi Visarpa [V-K-type]:

[Here follows one or 2 pages on treatment of Granthi Visarpa.]

## Treatment of Granthi Visarpa [V-K-type] which is predominant in rakta-pitta:

 the time-knowing physician should manage the case with roughening, lightening, sprinkling, pastes of pancavalka, blood-letting by leeches, emesis, purgation and astringent-bitter ghrtas.

Ci21#118-119

 When the patient of Grahani Visarpa is cleansed upwards and downwards [by emesis and purgation], and blood-letting has been performed, then measures alleviating V and K should be done.

Ci21#120

## When there is pain in Granthi visarpa:

 poultice of hot and unctuous utkarika or vesavara [dietary preparations: gruel-pastes] should be applied on the painful part.

 Also, it should be sprinkled with hot oil prepared of dasamula, hot kutha taila + cooked alkali or cow's urine or hot decoction of leaves. [Those are separate sprinkling applications.]

 The part should be pasted on with pounded and hated asvagandha, paste of dried radish, bark of naktamal or the hot paste of bibhitaka bark.

The following is a paste for Granthi Visarpa:

gulma-breaking measures, as said earlier [in chapter on gulma and shotha;

swelling].

Compression of the gland with- iron, salt, stone gold or copper.

Ci21#129

#### Use of Cauterization for Glands:

If the strong, firm and stony hard granthi does not subside by the above remedies, then it should be cauterized with alkali, iron arrow or gold.

Ci21#130

### Use of Surgery for Glands:

 Or, after making the gland suppurate by applying suitable drugs, one should open it [by scalpel] and extract the growth.

Ci21#131

# Blood-letting for Granthi Visarpa:

 Besides the above measures, the 'excited blood' should be eliminated frequently. This should be followed by administration of drugs to pacify both V and K.

Ci21#132

# Other Therapies to use if Granthi is Still Not Responding to Above Therapies:

One or more of the following may be used:

smoking

head evacuation

sudation

compression

suppuration

Ci21#133

#### Treatment when the site is decomposed, with inflammation and suppuration:

 use external and internal cleaning and healing measures as is done for treatment of wounds. (See chapter on treatment of wounds.)

Ci21#134-135

Ci21#138

Thus the treatment of Granthi Visarpa.
<!-- Page 571 -->

# Treatment Galaganda (Goiter):

## Treatment of K-type Galaganda (goiter)

 Treatment measures for granthi visarpa are used for treatment of K-type Galaganda (goiter).

Ci21#139

#### Treatment of V-types Galagana associated with K:

 These are destroyed by regular use of ghrtas, milk and decoction s. Ci21#140

# Importance of Blood-Letting:

 "All the remedial measures for visarpa are on one side and blood-letting alone on the other."

 [interpretation: blood-letting is as effective as all the other remedial measures put together.]

 [though this may have a different intended meaning.] Ci21#141

## Association of Rakta-pitta [hemorrhage] with Visarpa:

 "Visarpa does not arise without association of rakta-pitta, hence entirely general management has been described."

[interpretation: for management of raktapitta, see the chapter on that condition.]

 Certain variations of Visarpa have been discussed briefly in this chapter, but the wise physician will find the information here in sufficient detail.

# About sri Punarvasu:

 The son of Atri, famous for this knowledge, serenity and penance and engaged in welfare of the world said the treatment for pacification of 5 types of trsna.

Ci22#3

# Types of Trsna:

there are 5 types.

Ci22#3

### Etiology of Trsna:

excitement

fear

exertion

grief

anger

excessive lightening

wines

habitual intake of alkaline, sour, salty, pungent, hot, rough and dry food

depletion of dhatus

emaciation by disease

excessive application of emesis etc. [the Pancha Karmas]

intense heat of the sun

Ci22#4

# Pathology of Trsna:

 Due to the above etiology, P and V get aggravated, and thus dry up the **'saumya' ('soft') dhatus** [this is an important term and concept which has not been mentioned elsewhere] and also dry up the blood vessels of the root of the tongue, of the throat, palate and kloman [[pancreas]], and thus, being very strong, cause trsna.

Ci22#5

### Symptoms:

 The patient drinks water frequently but as they (V and P) absorb it quickly, he does not get solace.

Ci22#6

### Trsna as a Complication of Wasting:

 Trsna appears as a complication in people who are emaciated due to severe diseases.

Ci22#7

## Prodromal Symptoms of Trsna:

dryness of the mouth

Ci22#8

### Specific Characters [Symptoms] of Trsna:

longing for water

### Signs that Trsna is being Diminished:

the symptoms diminish.

Ci22#8

### Symptoms of 'manifested' Trsna:

dryness of the mouth
<!-- Page 574 -->

hoarseness of voice dryness of lips, throat and tongue 'loss of mind (concentration)' protrusion of the tongue anorexia deafness affliction in the heart lassitude Ci22#9-10

# Etiology and Pathology of V-type Trsna:

 When vitiated V dries up the fluid portion of the body, the weakened patient is dried up and consequently suffers from trsna.

Ci22#11

Symptoms of V-type Trsna:

 sleeplessness giddiness dryness and distaste in the mouth obstruction in the channels Ci22#12

# Etiology and Pathology of P-type Trsna:

 P is regarded as 'agneya' (of fiery nature) and so when it gets vitiated it heats the fluid portion of the body which produces thirst predominant in burning sensation.

Ci22#13

# Symptoms of P-type Trsna:

 bitterness in the mouth heat in the head patient welcomes cold fainting yellowness of the eyes, urine and stool Ci22#14

#### **Etiology and Pathology of Trsna Due to Ama:**

 **Thirst caused by ama is also agneya (fiery) in nature because it is produced by ama and P together.** 

Ci22**#15** 

### **Symptoms of Trsna Caused by Ama:**

 **anorexia tympanitis excessive salivation** Ci22#15

[this Ama-type Thirst is important; it is one of the most common types seen in the clinic today. Differentiation is possible by looking carefully for it's symptom set, and a recent history of ama-vitiating etiology, as well as heaviness and ama presence at time of symptoms.]

#### The body is Produced from Water:

The body is a product of rasa [(blood plasma tissue)], which is itself produced
<!-- Page 575 -->

from water.

Ci22#16

# Relation of Rasa Dhatu [blood plasma] and Thirst:

Due to diminution of rasa, one is inflicted with thirst.

Ci22#12

## Further Symptoms of Thirst/ [Symptoms More Specifically of Diminution of Rasa Dhatu]:

feebleness of voice

 **feeling of darkness (or fainting)**

 **'dryness of the heart'**

dryness of the throat and palate

 [the fainting and dryness of the heart I believe are somewhat particular to diminished rasa dhatu.]

Ci22#16

#### Thirst as a Complication of Certain Diseases:

 Thirst which appears as a complication in fever, prameha, wasting, phthisis "etc." is troublesome and leads to further emaciation.

 [I do not know what other diseases "etc." is supposed to imply; perhaps any disease which has been described to have thirst or lead to thirst as a complication.]

 [Note: this line may be one of the few stated connections between Prameha ('Diabetes') and thirst, and the fact that diabetes which has advanced to the stage of causing excess thirst will be debilitating and emaciating.]

Ci22#17

### Prognosis of Trsna:

All types of trsna are taken as fatal if they are one of the following conditions:

-occurring continuously

-occurring in a person reduced by some disease (particularly constant

vomiting)

 -associated with a severe complication Ci22#18

## [Re-Iteration of the] Involvement of P and V in the Pathology of All Types of Thirst: [Combine with above Sections.]

 There is no thirst without P or V because they are the agents of absorption of body fluid.

 So, when they get aggravated too much they lead to loss of fluid and consequently produce thirst.

**Even thirst due to heavy food, milk and fatty substances, the agents of thirst are P and V.** 

 **Even in thirst due to 'burning' [turning to sour/ acid] of food by obstruction in the passage [G.I. tract], the agents of thirst are P and V.** - Ci22#19-20

# How Wine Causes Thirst [[only in Alcoholics]]:

Wine has sharp, hot and rough nature.
<!-- Page 576 -->

This aggravates P and V, which thus absorb the body fluids 'in alcohol addicts'.

 'As water poured over the sand is absorbed quickly, the above patients heated too much find solace by drinking cold water.'

Ci22#21-22

#### Importance of Not Giving Cold Water To Person Exhausted by Heat:

 "In a person having bathed with cold water the heat blocked gets into the belly and causes thirst.

 Hence one should exhausted with heat should not come in contact with cold water suddenly."

 [Interpretation: in a person who is exhausted with heat then goes and takes a cold bath, the existing heat in the body gets blocked in the belly and causes drying of the rasa, thus causing thirst.

 So, one should not give a person exhausted by heat cold water to drink or bathe with.]

Ci22#23

"In all types of trsna the symptoms pertain to V, loss of fluid and P.

 However, because of their different causes of origin, I will describe their treatment."

Ci22#24

## About Thirst Due To Excessive Loss of Fluid:

Excessive thirst due to loss of fluid dries up the patient and kills him instantly. Ci22#25

# Treatment of Trsna:

"Excessive thirst due to loss of fluid dries up the patient and kills him instantly. Hence one should:

This chapter discusses the early origins, properties and sources of poison. It also discusses the 'impulses' [[onset/ convulsions]], symptoms and treatment of poisoning.

Ci23#3

# Historical/ Mythical Origin of Poison:

 "While the ocean was being churned by gods and demons for [making] nectar, a human form which was fierce-looking and brilliant, with four large teeth, brown hairs and fiery eyes appeared before the origin of the nectar. The creatures were afflicted just by looking at him, and thus he was called 'Visa' (poison)."

Ci23#4-5

#### Types of Visa and Types of Treatment:

"Brahma (the creator) placed him ['Visa'] in **two sources**– mobile and immobile.

 "That **originates from water**, is of **2 types** and **fire-like** and has **8 impulses**, **10 properties** and **24 remedial measures**.

Ci23#6

"Because of it's watery source, it gets liquefied and flows like jaggery in rains but thereafter it is destroyed by Agastya (appearance of Agastya constellation in the sky) and as such **poison becomes mild in action after the rainy season (in autumn)".**

Ci23#7-8

## The following are known as 'Jangama' (of Animal Source):

 poison of serpents, insects, rats, spiders, scorpions, house lizards, leeches, fishes, frogs, hornets, lizards, dogs, tigers, jackals, hyenas, mongooses and other fanged animals. Ci23#9-10

#### The following are known as 'Sthira' (of Vegetable Origin):

 mustaka, pauskara, kraunca, vatsanabha, balahaka [balathaka], karkata, kalakuta, karaviraka, palaka, indrayudha, taila, meghaka, kusapuspaka, pundarika, langalaki, anjanabha, sankoca, markata, srngivisa, halahala and other similar root poisons.

Ci23#11-13

### 'Gara' (Poisonous Combination of Substances):

 'Gara' is a toxic combination of substances, non-poisonous or poisonous, which exerts a toxic effect after interval of some time and as such does not kill the patient instantly.

Ci23#14

#### Symptoms of Animal-type Poison:

*sleep drowsiness exhaustion burning sensation inflammation horripillation*

*edema diarrhea*

Ci23#15

## Symptoms of Vegetable-type Poison:

*fever* 

*hiccup* 

 *sensitiveness of the teeth* 

 *spasm in the throat* 

 *frothy saliva*

 *vomiting* 

 *anorexia* 

*dyspnea*

 *fainting*

## [Different Sources/ Body-Location Affinity of Animal vs. Vegetable Poisons]:

 "The animal poison is situated below while the vegetable poison is situated above.

Hence one counteracts the other."

Ci23#17

## [[Use of Animal Poison for Treating Vegetable Poison and Vise-Versa]]:

 "The animal poison is situated below while the vegetable poison is situated above.

Hence one counteracts the other."

## **The 10 Properties of Poison:**

```
 light 
 rough 
 quick-acting 
 non-slimy 
 quickly-absorbed 
 sharp 
 "vikasi (depressant)" 
 suksma (minute) 
 having undefinable taste
 Ci23#24-25
```
<!-- Page 590 -->

# **Pathology/ Action of Poison:**

 **It vitiates V due to roughness** 

 **It vitiates P due to hotness** 

 **It vitiates rakta due to minuteness (quality of entering into fine channels)** 

 **It vitiates K and 'annarasa (chyle)' due to undefined taste.** 

 **It is absorbed quickly due to vyavayi [mobile] property.** 

 **It pervades the entire body due to 'asu' (quick acting) property.** 

 **It effects the vital organs due to sharpness.** 

 **It effects the vital breath due to vikasi ["depressant" – but what is the definition I know for this word?] property.** 

 **It is difficult to manage due to lightness.** 

 **It does not adhere to dosas due to non-slimy-ness. [and thus can not be evacuated along with dosas.]** 

 **And yet it aggravates/ vitiates any of the dosas due to it's location and patient's constitution.**

Ci23#26-27

## Effects of Poison in a Person of V Constitution:

 the poison effecting the location of V [[colon/ others such as joints, vital organs/ a diseased area with V dosa] shows the symptoms of K and P slightly.

 Thirst, confusion, restlessness, fainting, spasm of throat, vomiting, frothing etc. are the symptoms in this condition.

Ci23#28

#### Effects of Poison in a Person of P Constitution:

 The poison effecting the seat of P exhibits symptoms such as thirst, cough, fever, vomiting, exhaustion, burning sensation, vision of darkness, diarrhea 'etc.'.

The symptoms of K and V are exhibited less.

Ci23#29

### Effects of Poison in a Person of K Constitution:

 The poison effects the seat of K and shows the symptoms such as dyspnea, spasm of throat, itching, excessive salivation, vomiting 'etc.' and the symptoms of V and K are less.

Ci23#30

# Symptoms of "Dusivisa" '(latent poison)':

 This produces pustules, kitibha [look this up] and urticarial rashes due to disorder of blood.

Ci23#31

## Pathology/ Mechanics of Poisoning:

 The poison effects each dosa, [which creates great weakness of the dhatus and organs].
<!-- Page 591 -->

Ci23#31

### Prognosis of Poisoning:

'The poison takes away the life very soon by affecting each dosa."

Ci23#31

## Movement/ Circulation of Poison Once It Has Entered the Body:

 "Blood flows down due to heat of poison and it kills the man by blocking the channels."

 "The poison which has been ingested (swallowed) stays in the heart of the dead." [It goes to the heart directly upon being swallowed, and stays there even after death.]

 "The poison entering the body by a bite or sting is located at the particular site." Ci23#32

# Signs of [Approaching/ Current] Death:

blueness of the lips and teeth (cyanosis)

prostration

falling of the hair

loss of movement and '[thrown] out limbs' [flailing the limbs]

no horripilation with cold [chilling the person does not produce goose-bumps]

beating the person with a stick does not produce any marks (redness/ bruise).

No bleeding on injury (making a cut /incision in the skin).

[No mention of pulse or respiration!]

"These are the signs of death.

"In the absence of them, the patient should be treated."

 [So, even if heart beat and respiration are not present, if the above signs are not present, there is hope of resuscitation.]

Ci23#33-34

Ci23#35-37

#### Treatment of Local Poisoning by Bite, etc.:

 In case of the bite-poison which has not spread (is localized), the physician should:

- 1) bind a tourniquet above bitten point and
- 2-A) compress it fully

or

2-B) should extract the fang (through incision) except in vital part

or

2-C) should suck the poison out through his mouth

# **Preparation for the physician who will suck out poison from a**

# **patient's bite:**

# **He should first fill his mouth with barley powder or**

**dust.**

 [Note: the above may not be a fully accurate interpretation of the options for this life-or-death procedure, so review the original text sutra here.]

Ci23#38

#### Elimination of Poisoned Blood:

 Therefrom blood should be eliminated through scraping, application of horn or leech or venesection because blood being affected by poison, the constitution is deranged and thus the patient expires.

 Hence, if blood is not coming out, it should be impelled by application of rubbing powders such as of trikatu, soot, haridra, five salts, goracana [[cow's bile]] and vartaka.

 When the bleeding is excessive, paste of cold drugs like vata etc. should be applied.

 "Blood blows up the poison as air blows up the fire, by application of cold paste or sprinkling blood drops down and as such the force of poison goes away."

[Try to interpret the above sentence.]

 Due to force of poison, narcosis, fainting, affliction and palpitation of heart arise. These should be averted with cold applications.

# **Moreover, the patient should be fanned till there is horripilation [goosebumps].**

 [So that the patient is refrigerated sufficiently that the poison will not cause burning problems.]

Ci23#39-43

#### Benefits of Some Topical Treatments [for Localized Poisoning (Bites/ Stings)]:

 Poison does not advance after excision [removal] of the bite, just like a tree who's roots have been cut does not grow.

 "Sucking is taking out and aristaas (bindings) are like water bundhs." Application of heat (cauterization) burns the poison situated in twak (skin) and
<!-- Page 593 -->

```
mamsa (flesh). 
Blood-letting eliminates poison from the blood. 
Ci23#44-45
```

## Treatment of Poisoning Due to Ingestion:

```
 Treatment in the 1st Phase: 
The ingested poison should be eliminated by emesis. 
In the 2nd Phase: 
The ingested poison should be eliminated by purgation.
```

 "First of all, the heart should be protected and for this the medicines covering it [listed in this book for treatment of heart conditions] should be taken immediately as available",

```
 such as the following: 
Ci23#45-46

## Mrtasamjivana Agada:

 This [['agada']] alleviates all poisons, gives victory, **revives the apparently dead** by poisoning and destroys fever.
<!-- Page 596 -->

A house-holder, by using it as snuff, paste, amulet and smoking destroys evil spirits, poisons, organisms, in-auspiciousness, evil incantation, charms, fire, thunderbolt, enemies, bad dreams, evils caused by women, fear of untimely death, floods and thieves.

 This anti-poison formulation is revealed by Brahma 'before the appearance of nectar' and gives success in wealth, agriculture and other efforts, promotes auspiciousness, corpulence and life-span and is commendable:

 equal quantity of each- sprkka, plava, sthauneya, kamksi, saileya, rocana, tagara, dhyamaka, kumkuma, mamsi, surasa, agryaila (sthula ela), ala (orpiment), khadira, brhati, sirisa flowers, srivestaka, padma carati, visala, devadaru, padmakesara, sabaraka, realgar, kaunti, jati flowers, arka flowers, rasa (bola), haridra, daruharidra, hingu, pippali, lac, balaka, mudgaparni, candana, madhuka, madana, sindhuvara, aragvadha, lodhra, mayuraka, gandhaphala, makuli, vidanga

 All the above should be collected in the 'pusya' constellation. [A particular season.]

They should be pounded together. Then form into pills. - Ci23#54-56

## Other General/ Various Treatments to Be Done:

 binding of vessels, rubbing the site 'in reverse direction' [counter-clockwise?] and self-protection should be done.

 Dosa in the place of which the poison is situated should be overcome first. [before ... is done.]

 Of the poison is in the site of V [the colon], one should foment it and administer intake of the paste of tagara and kustha with curd.

 If [dosa] is in the site of P [small intestine]- ghee, honey, milk and water as intake, bath and sprinkling are prescribed.

If the poison is situated at the site of K [stomach], fomentation and venesection are applied.

 In case of 'dusivisa' or the poison is situated in the blood- venesection and the five evacuative measures should be done.

 Thus the physician should prescribe medicines taking all aspects into consideration.

**"However, he should, first of all control the (dosa at) [it's base ] site without antagonizing the one (poison) situated there."**

 [So generally/ in some instances, if there is aggravated dosas in addition to poison in the body, the dosas should be removed **1st**, but very carefully.]

Ci23#61-64

 If the patient with the passage of K affected by poison and blockade of V due to obstruction in channels respires as if dead and is devoid of symptoms of incurability, one should do the following:

Apply the paste of-
<!-- Page 597 -->

Carmankasa

Use: Dose: apply 40gm.

He should also-

 blow up the patient's nostrils: Powder of- katabhi, katuka + katpala

Or-

he may apply flesh of goat, cow, buffalo or cock [chicken] on the incised scalp.

 "Thus the poison is absorbed out." - Ci23#65-68 Treatment if there is obstruction in the nose, eyes, ears, tongue and throat: do- snuffing with-

In piles and hardness of bowels, it is pasted on the anus.

 Similarly, **in obstructed or abnormally presented fetus in women**, it is applied on the vagina.

In coryza, it is applied on the forehead.

 [there must be a clue for the successful treatment of abnormal presentation of fetus if this same formula is used both as a paste for this purpose and for coryza. Look into this.\*]

 It is applied in cases of scrotal enlargement, kitibha, kustha, leucoderma, eczema etc..

This anti-poison formula destroys the toxic effects of poisons as an elephant

## Mahagandhasti agada:

 [this formula is perhaps the longest (given the most sutras) in the whole Charaka] This anti-poison formulation containing 60 drugs and with un-failing effect was revealed by Tryambaka (Rudra) to Kubera.

When applied as intake, collyrium and local paste it performs all the functions.

 By constant use with observance of wholesome and measured diet it destroys eye diseases (pilla, itching, timira, night-blindness, cataract and arbuda), irregular fever, indigestion, skin diseases (ringworm, itching, eczema and pimples).

 It destroys quickly the poisons of all rats, spiders, serpents and also of roots and tubers.

If one smears his body with it, he can hold the snakes and ingest poisons.

Even destined by death, he lives always free from the disorders.

In hardness of bowels, it is applied as a paste mainly on the anus.

## **In obstructed labor it is applied as a paste on the vagina.**

In fainting it is applied on the forehead.

 Musical instruments like bheri, mrdanga and pataha (types of drums) and banners should be pasted with this medicine and sounded or shown for counter-acting the snake poison.

 Wherever this formulation is present, no child's seizures, no demons, no inflicting vetalas and no Atharvanic mantras (magic spells) can stand.

 Where there is mahagandha hasti none of the grahas (seizures), fire, weapons, king or thief can succeed and prosperity abides there.

My salutation is offered to Visnu who is lion among the persons, creator of the entire universe, Krsna, the eternal one and Bhava (Rudra), the omnipresent one. The powerful lustre of sun as well as Brahma and Indra is in the god of death. I do not know it as possible like the defeat of Vasudeva (Krsna) mother's marriage and absorbing the ocean. By this truthful statement may this formulation succeed. O the best among all the medicaments! Conjoined by 'hilimili' protect me, I call upon you.'*

 It carries [carried] the sacrifice by the use of which Indra (who had been 'depressed' [wasted] too much and was devoid of energy and covered with ignorance due to excessive intake of soma) was extricated from the difficult condition.

 It is useful in sacrifices, and as such is looked at, touched and processed by the sacrificing sages according to vedic rites for the success of the sacrifice.

 Though wine has many variations according to source, processing and name, etc., it is only characterized by one thing: producing narcosis.

Wine is excellent solace to the gods as [who call it] nectar.

It is the power of Sarasvati, the prowess of Indra.

It is the accomplished Soma in sautramani sacrifice.

**It is 'the great potent'.** 

 **It destroys grief, restlessness, fear and agitation.**

'Madya (wine)' having entered into the heart counteracts the 10 properties of ojas with it's corresponding 10 properties and thus upsets the mind. - Ci24#28-29

The 10 properties are: light, hot, sharp, finely entering, sour, quickly absorbed, quick-acting, rough, 'depressant' [[reducing]] and non-slimy. - Ci24#30

<u>The 10 properties of Ojas are:</u> heavy, cold, soft, smooth, viscous, sweet, stable, clear, slimy and unctuous.

Wine counteracts the properties of ojas by it's own properties such as heaviness by lightness, coldness by hotness, sweetness by sourness, softness by sharpness, clarity by quick action, unctuousness by roughness, stability by quick absorption, smoothness by depressant action, sliminess by non-sliminess and viscosity by subtleness.

Thus disturbing ojas, the mind gets affected quickly, which causes narcosis [unconsciousness].

Ci24#31-34

The heart is the seat of the channels of rasa, vata etc., psyche, intellect, senses, self and primary ojas.

Hence by excessive drinking and consequent damage of ojas thereby, the heart as well as the dhatus located there get effected.

Ci24#35-36

# The Stages of Intoxication:

1<sup>st</sup> Stage: This starts when the heart is stimulated but the ojas is not affected.

2<sup>nd</sup> Stage: This starts when the ojas is damaged.

3<sup>rd</sup> Stage: This starts when the ojas is damaged severely. - Ci24#37

Wine Made of Flour Does Not (Severely) Damage Ojas:

Note: 'Such severe damage of ojas is not affected [caused] by wine made of flour, because the properties of depressentness, roughness and non-sliminess are not so aggravated therein.'

Ci24#37-38

## <u>Process of Intoxication:</u>

When the heart is overpowered by the properties of wine, the following arise: exhilaration, thirst, enjoyment, happiness and other peculiar rajasic and tamasic mental aberration.

This culminates in narcosis

The derangement caused by wine is called 'mada' (narcosis or intoxication).

Ci24#39-40

### The 3 Stages of Intoxication:

#### the First Stage:

exhilaration

person pronounces the merits of the food and drinks
<!-- Page 620 -->

he invokes instrumental and vocal music, laughter and anecdotes intellect and memory are not effected the senses are still mostly functional sleep and waking are normal Thus it is pleasure-giving.

### the Middle Stage:

 'There are memory and confusion' distinct speech followed by indistinct speech proper and improper excessive talk excessive movements incoherence in standing, food and drink and talk

> The people predominant in rajas and tamas having crossed the limit of the middle stage, but not yet reached the 3rd stage show the following in addition:

 behaving unwholesomely not sparing anything

> -Anyone who would let themselves get to this stage, which is like severe insanity, is foolish.

### the Last Stage:

the person becomes motionless like a piece of wood.

His mind is covered and with narcosis and confusion.

Though alive, he appears as though he is dead.

He does not perceive the pleasurable perceptions.

He doesn't recognize his friends.

He is not enjoying himself at this point (which is the point of wine after

all).

-Why would a person want to go to this stage?

He becomes ill-spoken, despicable and unwelcome by all beings.

Because of addiction he acquires painful diseases as a consequence.

Ci24#41-45

# Importance of the Mind Being Able to Concentrate:

 The well-being in this life and the here-after [next life or heaven], as well as highest bliss which is in liberation [samadhi] all depend on the mind being able to concentrate.

Ci24#52

# The Agitating Effect of Wine On the Mind:

 Wine creates a great agitation of the mind, just like a terrific storm does to the tree on a river bank.

Ci24#53

# Tendency of Rajasic and Tamasic Minds to Become Alcoholics:

 The fools overcome by rajas and tamas [see book I for definitions] take addiction to wine.

This wine has great drawbacks, and is a severely toxic form of pleasure.

Ci24#54

<sup>&#</sup>x27;The persons having their understanding affected by wine are bereft of sattvika qualities.
<!-- Page 621 -->

Those who are blinded due to intoxication and still hankering [for wine/ other unwholesome things] thereafter are deprived of all well-being.

 In wine, there is etiology of confusion, fear, grief, anger, death along with insanity, narcosis, unconsciousness, epilepsy and convulsion.

Where there is only derangement of memory there is everything ignoble.

That is why those knowing the defects of wine despise it with all efforts.

 Truly these great defects of wine are said, there is no doubt about them if wine is taken as unwholesome, in excess and without prescribed method.

But wine by nature is just like food.

 It causes disorders fi taken improperly, and is wholesome like nectar if it is used properly.

 Food is like vital breath for the living beings, but food can also become fatal due to indigestion.

 On the other hand, poison is fatal, but becomes health-promoting when used appropriately.

 Wine if taken regularly gives pleasant intoxication and produces exhilaration, energy, contentment, corpulence, freedom from disorders, sexual potency and strength.

Ci24#55-61

## Benefits of Wine:

 Wine improves relish and appetite, is cordial, promotes voice and complexion, is saturating, bulk-promoting, strength-promoting, alleviator of fear, grief and exertion, is 'hypnotic' [what is the intended meaning here?; this word has been used in the section on the '8 despicables' and sleep. Oh! It says after all:] ... is hypnotic for the sleepless, raises the voice of the dumb [those who do not speak], awakens those who oversleep, relieves constipation, and anesthetizes those pained with corporal punishment or imprisonment.

**Even the disorders caused by wine are counteracted by wine itself.**

Ci24#62-65

## \* Wine **creates enjoyment, liking and attachment to the sense objects in the elderly people** and "produces ceremonial pleasure".

 [\*\* Perhaps wine for geriatrics is a new application for modern medicine.] Ci24#66

## Use of Wine for Relief of Pain and Grief:

 Wine used properly is the resting place for the living people who are inflicted with intense pain and are marred with grief.

Ci24#67

## [How to Drink]:

 One should drink always keeping in view the 6 triads of: food, drinks, age, disorder, strength and time, as well as the 3 dosas and the 3 types of psyche.

Correct planning of these 8 Triads is said as 'yukti' (proper way).

If one takes wine in this proper way, one does not receive it's defects.

 The person who is predominant in sattva qualities of the psyche is able to enjoy wine without causing loss of virtue or wealth.

Ci24#68-70
<!-- Page 622 -->

#### State of the Psyche in the 3 Stages of Narcosis:

ordinarily the psyches are stimulated in the 1<sup>st</sup> stage of narcosis. During the 2<sup>nd</sup> stage they descend toward the sub-conscious level. In the last stage they drop totally into the sub-conscious level.

Rains stimulate the growth of the crop and fire exposes the nature of gold. Wine does likewise to humans; just as fire shows the nature of gold, such as superior, average and inferior, so does wine show the nature of men.

Ci24#70-73

# <u>Description of a Sattvic Drinking Party:</u>

The drinking party of perfumes, garlands and music, well-arranged, uncrowded, provided with delicious food and drinks, clean, always engaged in sweet talks, having comfortable drinking, offering desirable intoxication, promoting exhilaration and pleasure, with good participants and not inducing the third stage of intoxication is know as a sattwika one [party].

The persons predominant in sattva do not get affected suddenly by the untoward effects of wine because their psyche is strong.

Ci24#74-76

#### Description of a Rajasic Drinking Party:

it is mostly full of mild or harsh talks, clean or un-clean in movements, having various colors ad often crowded with bad people.

Ci24#77

# Description of a Tamasic Drinking Party:

it is devoid of exhilaration, pleasure, there is little talk, people are dissatisfied with the food, and everyone ends with excessive stupor, anger and sleep.

In a drinking party one should identify the sattvic, rajasic and tamasic people and avoid the negative types there.

Ci24#78-79

# The Right Drinking Companions:

those companions are pleasure-giving in drinking who are of pleasant disposition, sweet speech, good-looking, approved by the noblemen, not inconversant in arts, clean, and adept in senses, mutually submissive, one with friendship, increasing festivity in drinking party, more than a festival on mutual meeting one feels happy while drinking with them.

Those are fortunate who drink with pleasing vision, smell, taste, touch and sound with good companions.

One should drink with pleasing and favorite fine sense objects in proper place and time with exhibit and self.

Ci24#80-85

# The People who do not get intoxicated suddenly:

Those having firm psyche [let's just start saying 'Mind' instead of 'psyche', O.K.?] and body, have taken food before-hand, are born in a family of drunkards and who are used to plenty of wine.

Ci24#86

#### The people who get intoxicated Quickly:

The people who are striken with hunger and thirst, weak, predominant in V and P, taking rough, little and deficient food, having hardness in the bowels, mental weakness,
<!-- Page 623 -->

anger, who are not used to drinking, are wasted, tired and affected by narcosis get intoxicated quickly even by a small quantity of wine.

[[Perhaps– a lot of the above information should be merged, sorted, and perhaps reduced 30% in content, as it's repetitive.] - Ci24#87

Finally, here is Etiology, Pathology, Symptoms and Treatment of Alcoholism Proper:

## Etiology of V-type Alcoholism:

 If a person who is emaciated too much due to the following, it causes alcoholism predominant in V:

 excessive intercourse grief fear load-carrying and traveling taking rough, little or deficient food or drinks taking rough and **old** wine in excessive quantity [so old wine is indeed rougher than new wine.] taking wine during the night getting insufficient sleep Ci24#89-90

## Symptoms of V-type Alcoholism:

 hiccup dyspnea tremors in the head pain in the sides vigil [not sleeping] frequent delirium. - Ci24#91
<!-- Page 624 -->

### Etiology of P-type Alcoholism:

 intake of sharp, hot and sour wine in large quantity while using sour, hot and sharp items in the diet while taking irritant substances who likes exposure to fire, heat and the sun Ci24#93-94

# Prognosis of P-type Alcoholism in a V Constitution Person:

 P-type alcoholism occurring in a person of V constitution either gets pacified quickly [is easy to pacify/ must be pacified quickly] or it becomes fatal.

Ci24#94

# Symptoms of P-type Alcoholism:

thirst

burning sensation

fever

sweating

fainting

diarrhea

giddiness

greenish complexion

Ci24#95

### Etiology of K-type Alcoholism:

 intake of fresh (new) and mostly sweet wine made of jaggery or flour in excessive quantity

predominance of sweet, unctuous and heavy diet

lack of exercise

sleeping in the day time

spending the day lying in bed or sitting in a comfortable chair

Ci24#96

# Symptoms of K-type Alcoholism:

vomiting

anorexia

nausea

drowsiness

stiffness

heaviness

feeling of cold

Ci24#97

#### All Wine Vitiates All 3 Dosas, Similar to True Poison:

 The properties of poisons that vitiate all the dosas simultaneously are also present in wine.

 The only difference is that this effect is more powerful in the case of true poisons. Some poisons are fatal immediately, while others cause some non-fatal disorder.

 The last stage of intoxication should be considered [and treated] like a case of poisoning.

Hence, aggravation of all the dosas will be found in all the types of alcoholism.

Therefore, treatment will depend on the predominant dosa by each case.

Ci24#98-100
<!-- Page 625 -->

## General Symptoms of Alcoholism:

severe physical distress

mental confusion

cardiac pain

anorexia

continued thirst

fever characterized by cold and heat

pain like electric shock in the head, sides and bone joints

severe yawning

twitching

tremors

exertion

obstruction in the chest

cough

vomiting

diarrhea

nausea

symptoms of V, P and K

giddiness

delirium

visual hallucination

 the person covers himself with grasses, ash, creeper, leaves and dust the person has unstable mind and thinks he is assaulted by birds the person sees terrible and inauspicious dreams .

Ci24#101-106
<!-- Page 626 -->

### Treatment of Alcoholism:

## General Treatment of Alcoholism:

## Tri-dosic nature of Alcoholism:

All types of alcoholism are tri-doshic, so first treat whichever dosa is predominant.

Ci24#107

# General Rule to Treat K First:

'In alcoholism the treatment should be for K because K is predominantly situated flanded by P and V.'

Ci24#108

#### Use of Wine In Treatment of Alcoholism:

 The disorder which is caused by improper drinking, excessive drinking or deficient drinking is in fact pacified by taking wine, but in proper quantity.

 After digestion of ama and the demerits of [the previous batch of] wine and the kindling of appetite and lightness, the patient should be given wine of the correct form that is suitable for him.

 This wine should be added with: sauvarcala, bida and rock salt along with matulunga and fresh ginger, mixed with water and in proper quantity.

Ci24#109-111

 When sharp, hot, sour and burning wine is taken in excessive quantity the excited chyle is burnt and acquires alkaline character.

 This produces internal burning, fever, thirst, mental confusion, giddiness and narcosis.

For pacifying this syndrome, one should prescribe intake of wine itself.

 Alkali gets neutralized immediately in combination of acid and wine is the best among the acidic substances.

 [[Here is the most direct reference in the text about **Acid-Base** Balance in the body. This is also an important reference to the bile being/ producing alkaline substance. And they understood that wine is highly acidic. This suggests that they were aware of the acid-base issue, but felt that it was not so important as a basic factor of health in internal medicine, as is being suggested in the present times.]

 Wine is: sour, with 4 subsidiary (secondary) tastes, which are: sweet, astringent, bitter and pungent.

 These added with the 10 properties (mentioned earlier in the chapter) become 14 [qualities] which are present in wine.

**Because of this, wine stands at the top of all the sour substances.** Ci24**#112-116**
<!-- Page 627 -->

### Treatment:

# Symptoms of V Which Is Obstructed In the Channels Due to Dosa Which Has Been Excited by Wine:

 intense pain in the head, bones and joints. [is this a hang-over?] Ci24#117

#### Treatment for This Obstruction of V:

for liquefying of the dosa, wine is the best thing to give

 This is because of it's qualities of quick-absorption, sharpness and hotness 'in spite of other remedial measures.' [?].

Ci24#118

# Benefits of Wine (Even in Treating Narcosis):

 Wine removes the obstruction of the channels, carminates wind, improves relish, stimulates digestive fire and becomes suitable by practice.

 On removal of obstruction in the channels and carmination of wind, the pain subsides, the disorders are alleviated and narcosis with it's complications is pacified.

 [According to western/ modern medicine, in most of the conditions of narcosis/ fainting one should not use wine, since wine is vaso-dilator, causing reduced blood pressure and thus reduced blood flow to the brain, and thus aggravating the passed-out condition. This would include fainting due to blood-loss, shock, heat-stroke, postural hypotension, hypotension, and possibly alcohol intake also.]]

Ci24#119-120

### Treatment of V [In General/ V-type Alcoholism]:

 administer old wine made of flours + salt sours like- bijapura, vrksamla, kola and dadima powders of- yavani, hapusa, jiraka, sunthi Mix all of the above together. Use: before drinking this wine, one should eat foods having: parched gram flour + an uncting substance Ci24#120-121

 And having thick soup should be given with warm pupa (a dietary preparation).

Ci24#122-131

 After meals the patient should be given any of the following drinks if he has thirst:

## How to Drink Wine To Quench the Thirst [In case of Alcoholics]:

 Drink to quench the thirst should not be in such a quantity that it effects the mind. The wine should be diluted with plenty of water.

> This should be given repeatedly in small quantity, so that it pacifies the thirst, but not causes intoxication. - Ci24#150

Ci24#191-193

# The Necessity of Inducing Exhilaration:

# **'Wine produces narcosis without unagitating the mind and unaffecting the body hence exhilarating measure is necessary.'**

 [This is probably an important concept, but I do not yet fully grasp it. I believe much of the list directly above is aimed at producing exhilaration for this purpose, but the reason why is not yet fully clear to me from this sentence. ]

 [What it probably means is when someone is in narcosis due to wine (a stupor) his mind and body are un-responsive and sunken. Thus one should apply measures which revive him and re-engage him externally.]

Ci24#194

#### When to Use Milk Treatment Only:

 If the above tested measures do not subside the alcoholism, the physician should administer the intake of milk [as diet/ medicine regularly], and stop using any other remedies listed for alcoholism.

Ci24#195

### Benefits of Using Milk for Alcoholism:

 After discontinuing wine when K is diminished and debility and lightness arises due to lightening, digestives, evacuative and pacificatory measures and V and P become predominant in the patient inflicted with wine.

 In this case, milk acts as a boon, just like rains do for a tree parched in the summer sun.

Ci24#196-197

#### Schedule for Milk Use:

 When (by using the milk program) the disorder has been removed and strength is recovered, the milk should be discontinued.

Then wine should be resumed in small doses and gradually.

[[This is only for K constitution people/ K-type alcoholism.]]

Ci24#198

#### Symptoms of "Dhwamsaka" and "Viksaya":

 When a person who has discontinued drinking wine starts taking it in excessive amounts again, it is called 'dhwamsaka' and 'viksaya'.

Prognosis of these 2: they are difficult to cure, especially in the person who is
<!-- Page 637 -->

```
debilitated by disorders.
```

Ci24#199-200

## Symptoms of 'Dhwamsaka':

excessive salivation

dryness of the throat and mouth

intolerance to sound

excessive drowsiness as well as sleep

Ci24#201

## Symptoms of 'Viksaya':

abnormality in the heart and throat

mental confusion

vomiting

pain in the body

fever

thirst

cough

headache

This arises in people who are emaciated and debilitated.

Ci24#202

## Management of 'Dhwamsaka' and 'Viksaya':

It is the same as for V-type Alcoholism.

Enemas, intake of ghee, use of milk and ghee

massage

bath

food and drink which are V-alleviating

Ci24#203-205

The wise who keeps away from all narcotics and has controlled his senses does not get affected with physical or mental illness.

 [So what should be done for other drug addictions? For Opium? For Heroine? For Crack, etc.? Will \{some of} these same procedures be appropriate? My guess is that Yes they will, with some adjustments. Also, the Poison Treatment chapter may also be applicable to these other narcotics. ]

### Two types of wound have been listed earlier (see the section on enumeration of disorders).

They are:

1)Innate

This arises from the dosas within the body.

2)Exogenous

This is due to from external causes.

Ci25#5-6

## Etiology of Exogenous Wounds:

blowing

binding

falling down

injury with fangs, teeth or nails

poisonous contact

fire

weapons

Ci25#7

### Uniqueness of Treatment of Exogenous Wounds:

 'These are different from the innate ones in respect of treatment with incantations, anti-poison pastes, etc. etiology and partially symptoms.'

Ci25#8

## Treatment of Internal Secondary Cause of Chronic Un-healing Exogenous Wounds:

 If an exogenous wound does not get pacified, one should look for dosic imbalance which may be upholding it.

 In this case, it should be treated like an innate wound, according to predominance of dosas.

Ci25#9

### Etiology of Innate-type Wounds:

The dosas get vitiated in the **external passages** and thus cause wound.

Ci25#10

 Treatment General treatment Diet Formulas Topical formulas Use of Exercise
<!-- Page 659 -->

#### Irrelevance of Pancha Karmas for Urustambha:

 Urustambha is not amenable to the 5 evacuative measures, neither singly nor collectively.

Ci27#4-5

## Etiology of Urusthambha:

 Eating fatty, hot, light and cold food when the previous food is only partially digested and mostly undigested,

 Eating liquid or dry food, curd, milk, meat of domestic, marshy and aquatic animals, flour preparations, damaged wine, excessive day-sleep and vigil, under-eating, over-eating, exertion, fear, suppression of urges and unctuousness,

Ci27#6-8

### Pathology of Urustambha:

 Due to the above etiological factors, ama accumulated in the bowels and accompanied by medas obstructs the dosas and due to heaviness proceeds shortly to the thighs through the lower blood vessels etc. and pervading the legs, shanks and thighs, the morbidity aggravated by the strength of medas makes them out of volition and with restricted movements.

Ci27#9-10

 As still water in a full and deep big lake remains stable and without agitation, so K resides in the thighs and producing heaviness, exhaustion, contracture, burning sensation, pain, numbness, tearing pain, quivering and piercing in the body takes away life.

 The disease is called Urusatambha because K with medas subduing V and P stiffens the thighs with immobility and coldness.

Ci27#11-14

## Symptoms of Urustambha:

 [heaviness, exhaustion, contracture, burning sensation, pain, numbness, tearing pain, quivering, piercing, [death], immobility and coldness]

Ci27#11-12

#### Premonitory Symptoms of Urustambha:

'brooding over'

sleep

excessive feeling of wetness [of what body part/ mental ?]

anorexia

fever

horripilation

vomiting

lassitude in shanks and thighs - Ci27#14-15

# Urustambha as Complication of Improper Unction in Treatment of Vatavyadhi [paralisys etc. disorders]:

 Due to ignorance when under suspicion of vatavyadhi, one applies unction: it further aggravates and causes lassitude, numbness and difficult lifting of the legs.

 [This may be the most common manifestation of urustambha we ayurvedic practitioners in north America will see.]]

Ci27#16
<!-- Page 660 -->

excessive malaise of shanks and thighs

continuous burning sensation

continuous pain

feet ache when put on the ground

feet are unable to perceive cold touch

patient is quite incapable of standing, pressing, moving

 [when the therapist moves the patients' legs] movement causes sensation as if the thighs were broken off and are born by someone else.

Ci27#17-18

## Prognosis of Urustambha:

Incurable type:

the patient trembles and is affected with burning sensation, distress and piercing pain.

Curable type:

When the above are not present.

When the condition is very recent.

Ci27#19

## Reasons Why Purgation Measures Will Not Help Urustambha:

 In this disease, none of the unction, enema, purgation and emesis is applied because of the following reasons, listen:

Unction and enema lead to aggravation of K.

Purgation is not able to extricate K situated there [the small intestines].

It is easy to eliminate K and P situated in kaphasthana (stomach).

 K and P can be eliminated by purgation if they are situated in 'amasaya' [stomach].

 Even all the dosas situated in 'pakvasaya' [I thought this was colon] can be eliminated with enemas by striking at the root of morbidity.

 But when the two (ama and K) are located in the seat of V [Pakvasaya/ colon] as they are stiffened due to it's [their] coldness, they can not be extricated easily, just as water from a low ditch is hard to extricate.

Ci27#20-24

## Treatment of Urustambha:

General Treatment of Urustambha:

Apply constant diminishing and drying measures as pacificatory treatment.

This is to address the abundance of K and ama.

Ci27#25-26

## Diet for Treatment of Urustambha:

One should give this diet 'invariably'.

Barley, syamaka, kodo

## Parasites

 Diagnosis The 20 types of parasites The 4 types of parasites Those grown in external excreta Those grown in blood Those grown in mucus Those grown in feces

 Treatment The 3 steps of treatment Extraction Destruction of their source Abstinence of etiological factors formulas
<!-- Page 667 -->

Now will be discussed the topic of parasites inhabiting the persons in respect of etiology, location, form, color, name, effect and treatment.

Vi7#8

 20 types of pathogenic parasites have been mentioned earlier [[I may need to track this down and copy it from the book ]] from various points of view except the normal (non-pathogenic) ones.

Vi7#9

## The 4 types of Parasites:

 Parasites are divided according to their 4 material sources [body location within the host person where they lodge and grow]:

 Parasites which grow in feces, Parasites which growing in mucus, Parasites which grow in blood and Parasites which grow in external excreta.

Vi7#9

Excreta are of 2 types– external as well as internal. By the word "malaja" the parasites growing in external excreta are taken.

# The 3 Steps in Treatment of All Types Parasites:

Step I: the parasites should be extracted from the body.

 Step II: the source of their origin and development (impure mucus etc.) should be destroyed

 Step III: thereafter the patient should abstain from the etiological factors. Vi7#14

# General Therapeutic Application of the Above Concept:

 The 3-fold management which is mentioned in respect of parasites is applicable for controlling all disorders as well. **Evacuation, pacification and avoidance of etiological factors– these 3 should be applied properly in every disease.**

Vi7#28-30

### Step I- Extraction of the Parasites:

 Extraction is removal effected by hands with or without the help of instruments as necessary. Parasites located inside the organs are extracted, as a rule, by the (eliminative) therapy [part or all of the pancha karma sequence]. This is of 4 types such as head evacuation, emesis, purgation and non-unctuous enema. This is the method of extraction.

### Step II- Destruction of the source of their origin:

 Destruction of the source of their origin and development consists of the use of pungent, bitter, astringent, alkaline and hot drugs, and other measures which are contrary to K and feces. This is about destruction of the source.

### Step III- Abstinence from the etiological factors:

 Thereafter abstinence from the etiological factors– whatever is mentioned as causative factor and similar other substances should be avoided.

 Thus the principle of treatment by 3 stages has just been summarized. Treatment will now be described in detail:

Vi7#15

# [Step I- Extraction of the Parasites:]
<!-- Page 670 -->

The patient infested with worms should be first treated with unction and fomentation for 6 or 7 nights [i.e. 6 or 7 days].

 A day before administering the evacuative therapy he should be given a diet [meal] in morning and evening consisting mainly of milk, jaggery, curd, sesame, fish, meat of marshy animals, (rice) flour preparations, rice cooked in milk and kusumbha oil in order to stimulate the worms and impel them to the digestive tract. The next morning, when the patient is comfortably seated and has his meal [from the previous evening] properly digested, the evacuative therapy– non-unctuous enema, emesis and purgation– should be administered to him on the same day after examining all the aspects properly.

Vi7#16

Next the patient should be administered the following enema for 3 or 7 days:

 mulaka, sarsapa, lasuna [garlic], karanja, sigru, madhusigru, kharapuspa, bhustrna, sumukha, surasa, kutheraka, gandira, kalamalaka, parnasa, ksavka phanijjaka– all or whichever are available

 Cut the above into pieces, wash well with water, and put in a well-cleaned cooking pot.

+

equal parts of- cow's urine, water

Cook the above together, stirring constantly with a ladle.

 When the water is mostly consumed and the drugs are well-extracted the cooking pot should be brought down [off the fire].

Filter properly.

Cool the decoction so it is still tolerably warm but not hot.

+

paste of- madanaphala pulp, vidanga

oil

swarjika salt

Mix all of the above together.

 Use: put into an enema pot and with this non-unctuous enema should be administered to the patient properly.

It should be administered to the patient for 3 or 7 days

Note: Charaka says "the patient should be asked to bring the [above] drugs, all or whichever are available".

Vi7#17

The following is an alternate enema formula:

 The above enema may be prepared also with decoction of- arka, alarka, kutaja, adhaki, kustha and kaidarya

Vi7#17

The following is an alternate enema formula:

 The above enema may be prepared also with decoction of- sigru, pilu, dhanyaka, katuka and sarsapa

Vi7#17

The following is an alternate enema formula:

The above enema may be prepared also with decoction of- amalaka, srngabera,
<!-- Page 671 -->

daruharidra and nimba

Vi7#17

 After the last enema has come back the patient should be assured and on the same day evacuative drugs acting both ways [emesis and purgation] should be administered to him properly.

Vi7#18

For this purpose, one should use the following emetic-purgative formula:

One aksa (10gm.) paste of- trivrt

+

½ anjali (80ml) decoction of- madanaphala pulp

Mix the above together.

 Use: this formula should be administered to the patient; this eliminates the noxious material well from both ways.

Vi7#18

Creating other emetic-purgative formulas:

 In the same way as the above formula, emetics and purgatives mentioned in the kalpa section [see section on emetic and purgative herbs] may be administered after taking into consideration all the aspects.

Vi7#18

 When the patient is purged well, he should be bathed with the warm decoction of vidanga and he should use this for all purposes external as well as internal in place of water constantly; if it is not available, decoction of other pungent, bitter and astringent drugs or urine or alkalis may be used for bath. After bath he should be admitted to a room which is free from wind and should be managed with dietetic regimen starting with yavagu (liquid gruel) cooked with pippali, pippalimula, cavya, citraka and sunthi. In this way when he reaches the stage of vilepi (paste gruel) unctuous enema should be administered to him with vidangataila twice or thrice on alternate days [every other day].

Vi7#19

 If too much aggravated worms (maggots) creating trouble in the head are observed and sometimes moving in that, then after applying unction and fomentation to the head the patient should be administered head evacuation with the seeds of apamarga etc.

Vi7#20

 Now will be described some medicated food preparations for destroying the environment for growths of the parasites:

 the whole plant of mulakaparni along with root, top and branches Cut the above into pieces, then pound in a mortar. Extract the juice out of it by pressing with the hands.
<!-- Page 672 -->

+

flour of- red sali rice

Make the above into "pupalika" (cake [patty]).

These should be cooked on smokeless charcoal.

 Use: these cakes alongwith vidanga, oil and salt should be given to the patient infested with parasites for eating.

 Afterwards he should be given to drink the sour vinegar or diluted buttermilk mixed with 5 drugs of the pippalyadi group (pippali, pippalimula, cavya, citraka, sunthi) with a little salt.

Vi7#21

 In the same way, cakes may be prepared in the juice of one of these drugs– bhrngaraja, arka, sahacara, nipa, nirgundi, sumukha, surasa, kutheraka, gandira, kalamalaka, parnasa, ksavaka, phanijjaka, bakula, kutaja and suvarnaksiri.

Vi7#21

 Moreover, cakes may be prepared in the juice of kinihi, kiratatikta, suvaha, amalaka, haritaki and bibhitaka. Vi7#21

 The juice of these drugs should also be administered alone or in combination with another drug or all mixed together with honey to the patient on an empty stomach in the morning.

Vi7#21

The following powder should be be given to the patient:

fresh horse dung

Spread the above over a big mat to dry up in the sun.

 Then fine powder is made by pounding in a mortar and again grinding on stone slab.

+

decoction of- vidanga or triphala

 The powdered horse dung should be dipped well [soaked] in the above decoction, and again dried well in the sun.

This process is repeated 8 or 10 times.

 Finally, grinding it on stone slab fine powder is made and stored in a new jar in a protected place.

Use: take in dose of 10gm, or whatever is appropriate, mixed with.

Vi7#22

The following powder/ oil may be given. This entails an interesting heat-extraction procedure:

One kalasa (10.24kg)- stony fruits of bhallataka

 Crush the above and keep in a strong jar smeared inside with ghee having many fine holes in the bottom and wrapped all over with clay (and dried).

This jar having been covered with a lid is put on another strong and ghee-smeared
<!-- Page 673 -->

jar which is buried under ground up to it's neck.

Now it should be covered with cow-dung from all sides and ignited.

 When it is observed that the cow dungs are well-burnt and the stony fruits of bhallataka are freed from oil, the (upper) jar is taken out.

Now from the lower jar the oil is collected.

+

double quantity powder of- vidanga seeds

 Mix the above oil and powder together. They should be dried up in the sun for the whole day.

 Use: A dose of it is administered to the patient by which he is purged well. The after-management should be as said above.

Then, at appropriate time, unctuous enema should be given.

[\*\* This method of extracting Bhallataka oil by fire; the editor observed this procedure used for extracting oil of coconut shells at the Gujarat Ayurveda University. The only difference in their procedure was that the upper jar containing the shells to be extracted had a normal solid bottom. But it's top was covered with a filter-cloth which was tied with twine around the mouth of the jar. The jar was then placed upside-down over the jar below it, and the junction between them was [wrapped with cloth strips and then] further sealed with clay slip. Add this description to the text, with credit to Gujarat A.U. and also include a simple diagram with the 2 layouts.]

Vi7#23-24

By the same method, following instructions for the above powder/ oil formula, the oil obtained from the wood of devadaru and sarala may be administered.

Vi7#23-24

The following oil should be used:

 new [not aged] sesame seeds (these should be of best quality and harvested in the autumn)

Winnow and clean the seeds.

+

lukewarm decoction of- vidanga

Immerse the seeds in the decoction "till the noxious material comes out".

 Then again cleaning them well, they should be dipped in the decoction of vidanga and dried in the sun.

The process should be repeated 21 times.

Thereafter pound the seeds in a mortar and again grinding finely on a stone slab.

 Place the resulting paste in a tub and sprinkle fresh vidanga decoction over it again and again, while pressing it with hands.

During this process, whatever oil comes out should be collected by hands.

 This oil should be kept in a clean and strong jar which should be stored in a protected place.

 Note: the patient is asked to collect new sesame seeds and bring them to the doctor.

Vi7#25

The following oil may be used:
<!-- Page 674 -->

[The following contains a good general description of preparing a medicated oil by cooking; -signs of when it is ready. Duplicate this to section on general preparation of formulas- preparation of oils.]

 2 boluses of 40gm weight of the finely made paste of tilwaka and uddalaka with the decoction of vidanga

+

 2 similar boluses in half quantity (20gm) of the finely made paste of syama and trivrta with the decoction of vidanga

+

 2 boluses in further half quantity (10gm) of the finely made paste of danti and dravanti with the decoction of vidanga

+

 2 boluses in further half quantity (5gm)of the finely made paste of cavya and citraka with the decoction of vidanga

+

1.28L- vidanga decoction

640ml- vidangataila

Mix all the above together well.

 Then put it in a big vessel which should be put over fire. A person sitting comfortably on a seat and keeping eye constantly on the oil from all sides should cook it on mild fire while stirring with a ladle constantly. When one observes that sound is stopped [[bubbling from released water vapor]], foam is subsided, oil is clarified [easy to see through], proper smell, color and taste appear, the drug-paste when pressed with the fingers is made into a wick [it sticks together and can be rolled into balls or pencil shape], does not adhere to the fingers and is not too soft or too hard. This is the time for bringing down the vessel [taking off the fire].

 After the vessel is brought down and cooled, the content should be filtered through undamaged cloth.

 It should be kept in a clean and strong jar closed with lid and covered with a piece of white cloth and tied well with threads and stored in a protective place.

 Use: Appropriate dose of this should be administered to the patient by which he gets purged well.

 After proper elimination of the noxious material he should be managed as said before.

Then at appropriate time, unctuous enema should be administered to him.

Thus he becomes free from the disorders.

 Note: the patient is asked to bring the above required boluses to the doctor/ pharmacist to make the formula.

Vi7#26

The following oils may be prepared in the same way as the above formula:

 By the same method one should prepare oils of sarsapa, atasi, karanja and kosataki and administer to the patient considering all the aspects.

Vi7#26
<!-- Page 675 -->

## Summary:

 Of course, one should be particularly cautious in avoiding the respective etiological factors that cause infestation by parasites.

Vi7#27

 The remedy of the parasites is firstly their extraction, then destruction of their favorable environment [in the body], and finally avoidance of etiological factors Vi7#28-30

 Thus 20 types of parasites along with their cause etc. have been described. Vi7#31
