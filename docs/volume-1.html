<p>The Indian science of Ayurveda, or &quot;life knowledge&quot; has been practiced unbroken for thousands of years, handed down from teacher to student. Ayurveda provides the method for living a balanced life, for the prevention of disease and pain and for the treatment of diseases presently thought to be incurable. Unfortunately, during the period of British occupation of India, traditional arts, including the science of Ayurveda, were actively discouraged; &#x27;Vaidyas&#x27;, or accomplished Ayurvedic masters, were persecuted and numerous libraries and schools were burned to the ground. Since that time of foreign occupation, India and it&#x27;s culture have slowly been recovering. But the truth is that Ayurveda still remains in a semi-dormant state, a state of hibernation, waiting for those earnest and perseverant students who will bring Ayurveda back to it&#x27;s full capacity. Fortunately there are a few excellent texts which have been preserved from ancient times. The Charaka Samhita is such a text. Recorded several thousand years ago from the teachings of the sage Punarvasu Atreya, it is a gem of practical wisdom which remains to this day the most respected work on Ayurveda. And fortunately for those students not fluent in Sanskrit, a few good translations to English have been written.</p>
<p>So, what is unique about this version you are holding now? Great as the original Charaka Samhita is, it is challenging to read. Information is scattered over hundreds of pages and thousands of &#x27;sutras&#x27;. Further, it was written in poetic format which facilitated the memorization of the full text, but resulted in sentences that could confuse the inexperienced. Without ample insightful explanation from living teachers, this text has been out of reach to the average Ayurvedic student, simply too much effort. I offer this version as a comprehensive, user-friendly textbook for the medical student, and as a reference book for health practitioners. However, even the newcomer to Ayurveda will find interesting information on healthy living for happiness and longevity. The content of this book has been taken completely from P.V. Sharma&#x27;s English translation of the Charaka Samhita. Mr. Sharma has created an excellent English translation, with painstaking attention to correct interpretation of the details such as vocabulary, grammer and pharmacopoeia. Therefore, I have used the translations from his book word-for-word as the base of this book. Students who wish to study the original sutras from the Charaka Samhita are directed to the above text or one of the other fine translations. P.V. Sharma&#x27;s edition is available through Chaukhambha Orientalia Publishers in New Delhi, India. What I have done is spend several thousand hours interpreting and testing this information from an applied clinical standpoint. The information has been collected by subject. Unnecessary language has been pared down, in an attempt to illuminate the intended meaning of each aphorism. Compact, difficult portions have been expanded and explained. Headings have been installed at the beginning of each new group of information. Where appropriate, information has been grouped into charts for easier visual association. And what were complex bundles of formulas have been divided into individual formulas and written out into a recipe format so one may at a glance get a feel for the basic ratios and procedures involved. Finally, the information has been grouped into coherent chapters and larger &quot;sections&quot;. At the same time I have done my best to preserve the core message that was intended in each sentence of the original text. You can be confident that no information from the original text has been left out; this is not an abridged version. Consequently, when I did not feel confident to make an interpretation of a sentence or statement, I left it as I found it. You will notice that much of the text in</p>
<p>this book appears to be grammatically incorrect or incomplete. This is intentional and reflects the most accurate interpretation of the aphorisms that I felt I could make without sacrificing the original message. I may say that I have labored long and earnestly to form this text that it should become a firm and helpful guide to the student and doctor in daily use. I now send it forth in the confident hope that, the more it is put to the test of actual use, the more it will grow in the esteem of its possessor.That being said, this is a work-inprogress, and the editor earnestly requests Ayurvedic scholars, doctors and students to communicate any suggestions which may tend to improve this book for its second edition, which is currently under progress. Whatever can be done to make this book of greater service to the medical and scholastic institutions will be gladly undertaken.</p>

<ul>
<li class="">1)Each Section has it&#x27;s own table of contents for fast and easy access.</li>
<li class="">2)If you are new to Ayurveda, reading just for fun, I recommend that you browse through the various table of contents and pick out points that pique your interest. You will be surprised by the array of interesting information.</li>
<li class="">3)If you are under the care of an Ayurvedic doctor, or want to follow an Ayurvedic lifestyle, you only need to read Section 4, Healthy Living. You may also wish to read Section 1, Principles. Some parts of this book are technical, so if you are new to Ayurveda an introductory book such as Dr. Vasant Lad&#x27;s &quot;Ayurveda, the Science of Self-Healing&quot; may also be helpful.</li>
<li class="">4)If you are a practitioner, you will find diagnosis and treatment by disease name listed in the table of contents for Section 8, Specific Diseases. Further detail on evaluation, principles and treatments can be located in the other sections as needed. I should mention here that if you look at the table of contents for Section 8, Specific Diseases you will notice that there are a lot of diseases which are not listed. Further, there are disease categories which do not exist in Allopathic medicine. The outsider to Ayurveda may feel that this categorization in the Charaka Samhita is incomplete and antiquated. However, the further one studies and applies the diagnosis and treatment given in this classic text, the more one is impressed that this classification is complete, competent and in several cases is perhaps superior to the allopathic classification of diseases.</li>
<li class="">5)If you are a student, you may wish to read the chapters in order, or as your curriculum requires. One hint: studying at the beginning all of the table of content pages for each chapter is a good introduction to the breadth of Ayurveda, and will help you locate information when you need it in future.</li>
<li class="">6)Comments by the editor will be printed in <em>italics</em> or inside [brackets]. Items of particular interest will be marked in <strong>bold</strong> or with a * symbol.</li>
<li class="">7)When studying a statement, you can read it &quot;backwards&quot; to get twice as much information out of it. For example, in the statement &quot;Antagonism of foods becomes inert due to: suitability, strong digestive power and young age&quot; we can learn the direct statement, i.e. that suitability, strong digestive power and young age will all help us to avoid the problems of taking antagonistic foods. But we can also get insight about the nature of youth; there is something about youth that makes it particularly conducive to this effect. So, this one aphorism can tell us about not only antagonism of foods, but also about the characteristics of youth. All the statements in the Charaka can be used in this way to glean twice as much useful information.</li>
<li class="">8)Take the aphorism statements literally. You may be surprised by the wide yet specific application of what are apparently obvious aphorisms of the Charaka.</li>
<li class="">9)It is recommended that you learn most of the Charaka before applying it; there are many potentially dangerous procedures and medicines here. Also, the knowledge required for their proper management is interspersed throughout the eight sections, not just in the particular section it is listed. Many of the statements of the Charaka do not come into full meaning until viewed in context of the rest of the work. So, when something doesn&#x27;t make sense, continue studying the surrounding aphorisms or other related passages for clues. For example, the right application of a purgative formula may be further clarified upon study of paragraphs on &quot;strength of the patient&quot; and &quot;softness/hardness of the bowels&quot;.</li>

<p>A sutra is a verse or statement, like a sentence. Sutra means thread, because, like the surgical word to &quot;suture&quot;, a thread strings together a series of ideas. The Charaka Samhita is written in verse, to be chanted with a rhythm and meter. This aided the aspiring student in committing the sutras to memory. Unfortunately the rhyme and meter of the sutras are lost when translated into English, though we may catch their meaning. In order to aid scholars who wish to compare this edited version of the Charaka with sutras of the original, I have included sutra references. Each sentence, paragraph or chart will have a sutra reference below it, which indicates which sutras the information comes from. It looks like this:</p>

<p>It is defined as departure of memory associated with entering into unconsciousness and convulsions due to derangement of mind.</p>

<p>Ayurveda is said as eternally continuing because of it&#x27;s beginning-lessness, because the characters of [it&#x27;s] entities are determined by universal nature and because the characters of all substances are eternal.</p>
<p>There was never non-existence of the flow of life or intellect.</p>
<p>The knower of Ayurveda is also eternally continuing. [that is God/ the soul/ the successful human vaidya will gain immortality]</p>
<p>&quot;Pleasure (the state of health) and pain (the state of disease) along with material factors, causes and symptoms, because of their inter-relations, are also eternal.</p>
<p>All these point towards the eternal continuity of Ayurveda.</p>
<p>Also, the 10 pairs of qualities and the Law of Similars and the Law of Opposites (similar qualities increase each other; opposite qualities decrease each other) are all eternal.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the 5 elements, and their properties are also eternal.</p>
<p>&quot;Ayurveda never arose out of non-existence except understanding and precepts;&quot;</p>
<p>Some say it&#x27;s origin in view of these tow.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s natural characters are non-artificial as said here and in the first chapter such as hotness of fire and liquidity of water.</p>
<p>It has also got the eternal continuity of natural characters of entities such as increase in heavy substances, decrease in light substances by regular intake of the heavy one.</p>

<p>yukti (rationale)-- is the rational planning of therapeutic measures sankhya (enumeration)-- is mathematics including statistics</p>
<p>samyoga (conjunction)-- is the joining together of entities. It is of three types according to the active participation of both, all or only one partner. It is non-eternal. [this last statement is a profound philosophical one; no union is permanent, but rather only temporary. All entities are made of the temporary bonding of other entities. All living creatures are only the temporary union of the foods they have eaten, and will eventually disperse to become the foods of a different union or creature.] [Samyoga also refers to conjunction of herbs into formulas, of doshas and dhatus into disease, of multiple etiologies into single etiology, etc.]</p>
<p>vibhaga (disjunction)-- it is also of 3 types; vibhakti (excision), viyoga (disjoining) and bhagaso graha (division).</p>
<p>prthaktva (separateness) – is of 3 types; asamyoga (spatial separateness), vailaksanya (class separateness) and anekata (individual separateness).</p>
<p>parimana (measurement)-- denotes measures (of all types- including weights). samskara (processing)-- this is processing</p>

<h1>The Number of Tastes: 6</h1>
<h1>The 6 Tastes:</h1>
<p>Sweet (madhura), sour (amla), salty (lavana), pungent (katu), bitter (tikta), astringent (kasaya)</p>
<p>Su26#9</p>
<h1>About the 6 Tastes:</h1>
<p>They are present in all substances [every substance will contain at least a little of each of the 6 tastes] -Su1#65</p>
<p>But they are present in varying quantity from one substance to another [so sour taste is more present in lemons, for example, while pungent taste is more present in chili peppers.] -Su1#65</p>
<p>&quot;They are effected by varying ratios of the elements.&quot; As you will see below, each taste is made up of 2 elements. When these elements are combined in different ratios, the nature of the taste changes. This may be either an obvious or a subtle difference.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="su165">Su1#65<a href="#su165" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Su1#65" title="Direct link to Su1#65" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>Rasa [tastes in general] is made of ap (water) and prthvi (earth). Differentiation is due to relative amounts of the other 3 elements.</p>
<p>[The editor&#x27;s interpretation here is that: tastes in general are made of water and earth. What gives the taste of every substance it&#x27;s individuality is the variation of the other 3 elements (fire, air and space).]</p>
<p>Su1#64</p>
<p>&#x27;Ap&#x27; (water element) has the property of the sense of rasa (taste). -Su1#56 The primordial source of taste is water.</p>
<p>Su26#9</p>
<p>Rasa (taste) is the object of &#x27;Rasana&#x27; (&#x27;taste&#x27;).</p>

<p>Water is predominantly composed of &#x27;soma&#x27; (&#x27;ap&#x27;) (water element).</p>
<p>It is generated in sky [as rain].</p>
<p>It is naturally cold, light and having un-manifested rasas [it has no perceivable taste].</p>
<p>This water, while falling from the sky, gets endowed with the properties of 5 elements.</p>
<p>When this water has dropped to the ground, it nourishes the physical forms of animals and plants.</p>
<p>In these [the animals and plants] the 6 rasas (tastes) are developed. -this sutra: Su26#39</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="cause-of-variation-of-elements-and-thus-the-diffferent-character-in-the-tastes">Cause of variation of elements (and thus the diffferent character) in the tastes:<a href="#cause-of-variation-of-elements-and-thus-the-diffferent-character-in-the-tastes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cause of variation of elements (and thus the diffferent character) in the tastes:" title="Direct link to Cause of variation of elements (and thus the diffferent character) in the tastes:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Proportional variation of the 5 elements in the tastes of various substances is possible due to the change of seasons.</p>
<p>Each season is predominant in a different quality or element.</p>
<p>For example, plants grown in the late summer will have more fire element, and thus more pungent taste. Plants grown in the spring will have more water element and thus more sweet taste.</p>
<p>-this sutra: Su26#40</p>
<p>It is also due to various complexions and shapes in plants and animals. Su26#40</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-reason-why-the-number-of-tastes-is-only-6-and-not-innumerable">The Reason Why the Number of Tastes is Only 6, and Not Innumerable:<a href="#the-reason-why-the-number-of-tastes-is-only-6-and-not-innumerable" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Reason Why the Number of Tastes is Only 6, and Not Innumerable:" title="Direct link to The Reason Why the Number of Tastes is Only 6, and Not Innumerable:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The variations of substances coming together to form other substances with unique tastes is innumerable, but the 6 categories of tastes are limited because they are formed only by the 5 elements.</p>
<p>Su26#9</p>
<p>[consider putting the following in semi-chart form (see &quot;number of combinations of doshas&quot; for structure model)]</p>
<p>There are 63 types of variations of rasas according to substance, place and time, that is mentioned below:</p>
<p>By combination of 2 rasas (i.e., madhura + amla) there are 15 [options/ variations]</p>
<p>Likewise, by combination of the 3 rasas together, there are 20 &#x27;substances&#x27;.</p>
<p>&quot;By combination of 4 rasas together there are 15 substances such as sweet and sour get combined separately with 2 of the remaining rasas, likewise sweet and saline, and sweet and pungent with 2 of the remaining rasas.&quot;</p>
<p>Sour and saline with the remaining 2 rasas; sour and pungent, and saline and pungent have also similar combinations.</p>
<p>5 rasas combined together make 6 [options].</p>
<p>Single rasas separately make 6.</p>
<p>6 rasas combined together make 1 [option].</p>
<p>Thus according to various combinations of rasas the types of substances comes to 63.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="su2614-22">Su26#14-22<a href="#su2614-22" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Su26#14-22" title="Direct link to Su26#14-22" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The number 63 becomes innumerable considering the rasas and anurasas because rasas (themselves) transgress the number on account of their relative degrees. [In other words, there is innumerable subtle shades of difference in proportion of the 6 tastes from one substance to another, so the total number of tastes of all substances is innumerable.]</p>
<p>Su26#24</p>
<p>Properties are not said as located in properties (themselves).</p>
<p>Hence a physician should take the properties of rasas as those of dravyas, (taking into account) the different intentions of the author.</p>

<p>&quot;Some say– &#x27;there are no persons having all the 3 doshas in equilibrium because of the use of unbalanced food, thus some are having Vata constitution, some Pitta constitution and others Kapha constitution.&#x27; This statement not correct. Why? Because the physicians take the person having balanced V, P and K as healthy, health is normalcy and for the same object therapeutic measures are applied. Hence there are (person having prakrti as) balanced V, P and K but there are no prakrtis (constitution) like V, P or K. Because of predominance of certain dosha in person the respective dosha prakrti of the</p>
<p>same is said, but as there can&#x27;t be normalcy in imbalanced doshas they can&#x27;t be taken as prakrti. The concerned person can only be said as Vatika, Paittika or Kaphaja because they are in the state of abnormalcy.&quot;</p>

<p>Again, movement [action] of doshas is of 2 types– normal and abnormal. For instance, P having the nature of heat, is responsible for digestion in living beings but when vitiated it causes many disorders. K, in normal state, is responsible for strength but when abnormal becomes excretion [ama/ wastes/ mucus]. In other words, the normal K is said as ojas [and solid tissues] while the abnormal one is sinful (cause of various disorders). Likewise, all the movements are due to normal V and it is taken as life breath of the living beings but in abnormal state it produces disorders even obstructing the life breath.</p>

<p>V has 5 forms, or sectors in the body: Prana, Udana, Samana, Vyana and Apana Su12#8</p>
<p><strong>Characteristics in vitiation</strong>: roughness, coldness, lightness, non-sliminess, motion, formlessness, and instability. Producing these actions: separation, dislocation, division, attachment, tearing malaise, exhilaration, thirst, tremors, circumvention, looseness, piercing pain, pain , movement, etc.. Also coarseness, roughness, nonsliminess, porousness, reddish lustre, astringent taste, tastelessness, wasting, pain, numbness, contraction, stiffness, limping, etc.. -Su20#12</p>
<p>Also: affects strength, complexion, happiness and life span; agitates mind, affects all the sense organs, destroys, deforms or detains the embryo for long, produces fear, grief, confusion, anxiety and excessive delirium and (at the end) stops the vital breath.</p>
<p>Etiology of V&#x27;s vitiation in the dhatus:</p>
<p>Prolonged use of measures having similar qualities (to V).</p>
<p>Su12#5</p>
<p>Note: these measures/ substances need not come in direct contact with V in the dhatus to increase/ vitiate it.</p>

<p><strong>Now will be explained how the factors which vitiate or pacify V can do so without coming into contact with the formless and unstable V.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The V-vitiating factors produce roughness, lightness, coldness, hardness, coarseness, non-sliminess and hollowness in the body parts</strong> and <strong>V finding favorable environment there gets located in those body parts</strong> and because of nourishment [further increase of V-vitiating qualities in the body] gets vitiated.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the V-pacifying factors produce unctuousness, heaviness, hotness, smoothness, softness, sliminess and solidity. Thus V moving in such body parts <strong>finds no location</strong> and as such gets pacified.</p>

<p>Demonstrable Vs. Conjectured Anatomy:</p>
<p>What has been enumerated so far is visible and can be demonstrated.</p>

<p>Now the entities measurable in the unit of number of &#x27;anjali&#x27; are mentioned.</p>
<p>An anjali is a unit of measure generally equal to &#x27;a handful&#x27;, weighing 160gm.</p>
<p>However, for measurement of body fluids, the hand size should be the hand of the patient. (So a child will have 2 small anjalis of fat, and an adult will have 2 large anjalis of fat.)</p>
<p>[In some cases, this equal what can be held in the 2 hands cupped together.]]</p>
<p>These figures indicate mean standard and as such there is a scope of increase or decrease. [There is some range in volume from person to person.]</p>
<p>This information is also known by conjecture rather than by direct observation.</p>
<p>The following list of body components are liquid in form, and that is why they are best quantified by using a measurement of volume, such as anjalis.</p>
<p><strong>10 anjalis of fluid [basically water] which if discharged accompanies feces, urine, blood or other dhatus, circulating in the entire body is held up by the outermost layer of the skin, beneath the skin exists as lymph exuding through wounds; under influence of heat goes out of the hair follicles as sweat.</strong></p>
<p><strong>9 anjalis of the 1st dhatu being product of food and which is known as rasa.</strong></p>

<p>&#x27;Thus in essence the body is described.&#x27;</p>
<p>Sa7#15</p>
<p>Predominance of The 5 Elements in the Body Parts:</p>
<p>Body Parts Predominant in Parthiva (Earth element):</p>
<p>the body part which is particularly thick, stable, massive, heavy, coarse and hard; and nails, bones, teeth, flesh, skin, feces, hairs, beards and mustaches, skin hairs, tendons etc. along with smell and olfactory sense.</p>
<p>Body Parts Predominant in Apya (Water Element):</p>
<p>The liquid, mobile, dull, unctuous, soft and slimy;</p>
<p>rasa, blood, muscle-fat, K, <strong>P</strong> [it is surprising -but significant- that P has not been put under fire element], urine, sweat etc. alongwith taste and gustatory sense.</p>
<p>Body Parts Predominant in Agneya (Fire Element):</p>
<p><strong>P</strong> [so, P has been put in both water and fire elements], heat, lustre along with vision and visual sense.</p>
<p>Body Parts Predominant in &#x27;Vayaviya&#x27; (Air Element):</p>
<p>respiration, twinkling of eye, contraction and relaxation, movement, propulsion and retention alongwith touch and tactile sense.</p>
<p>Body Parts Predominant in Antariksa (Space Element):</p>
<p>the vacant space, <strong>big and small channels</strong>, alongwith sound and auditory sense.</p>
<p>&quot;Whatever impels is the principal one (principle of consciousness) along with intellect and mind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thus enumeration of body parts is done grossly.&quot;</p>
<p>Sa7#16</p>
<p>The body components according to division in smallest units (cells) are innumerable due to over-abundance, over-minuteness and transcending perception.</p>
<p>The causative agent in conjunction and disjunction of cells is vayu [V dosha/ air element] and also the nature of activities.</p>
<p>Sa7#17</p>
<p>Thus the body having many parts and enumerated above if seen &#x27;synthetically&#x27; [as a synthesis; as a whole] leads to attachment and viewed analytically leads to emancipation.</p>
<p>The principle one (consciousness) which is detached retires after all existent entities cease to exist.</p>
<p>Sa7#18</p>
<p>Summing up–</p>
<p>The physician who knows the enumeration of body parts does not get confused due to it&#x27;s ignorance.</p>
<p>One who is free from ignorance does not get overcome by the defects caused by it and as such he, devoid of defects and desires, calm, attains everlasting peace because he</p>
<p>is not reborn.</p>

Out of them the constituents having heaviness are increased by the prolonged use of heavy food items while those having lightness is increased by the light food items and the heaviness is decreased. In this way, all properties of the constituents are increased by the use of similar substances and decreased by that of contrary ones. Hence flesh is increased more in comparison with the other dhatus by (the use of) flesh, similarly, blood by blood, fat by fat, muscle-fat by musclefat, bone by cartilage, bone marrow by bone marrow, semen by semen and fetus by immature fetus (egg).</p>
<h1>Sa6#10</h1>
<p>In case, according to this similarity there is no availability of the similar food substances or, even if available, they can not be used due to impropriety or disgust or some other reason and the dhatu is to be increased necessarily, then the use of the food substances from different sources having predominance in similar properties is recommended such as- in deficiency of semen, the use of milk and ghee and other important sweet, unctuous and cold substances; in the decrease of urine, the use of sugarcane juice, saline and moistening substances; in diminution of feces, boiled cereals, black gram, mushroom, trunk of the goat, vastuka, vinegar prepared of rice; in diminution of V, the use of pungent, bitter, astringent, rough, light and cold substances; in diminution of P, the use of sour, salty, pungent, alkaline, hot and sharp substances and in diminution of , the use of unctuous, heavy, sweet, solid and slimy substances. The activities also may be performed which may lead to increase of the respective dhatu. Thus increase and decrease may be effected in other body constituents as well intime by application of similar and dissimilar substances.

<li class="">-Why does the morbidity of the srotas cause morbidity of the dhatus? There are 2 reasons:</li>
<li class="">
<ol>
<li class="">The formative ingredients of each dhatu must pass through the srotas. If these ingredients are blocked or altered, the dhatus will become weak.</li>

<p>Discussion: the Relationship of Body, Mind and Spirit:</p>
<p>O Wise! What are the types of the personal self according to constituents? Why is the personal self cause (of the body)? What is the source of the personal self? Whether he is knower or the ignorant? Whether he is eternal or non-eternal? What is Prakrti (nature)? What are the products? What are the signs of the personal self?</p>
<p>The knowers of the self regard the self as: inactive, independent, omnipotent, omnivagant, omnipresent, knower of the body and witness. Then O Lord! How there is action of the inactive? If independent, how is he born in an undesired form of existence? If omnipotent, how is he inflicted forcibly by painful entities? If omnivagant, how does he not perceive all the sensations? If omnipresent, why does he not see (an object) interrupted by a hill or a wall? There is no doubt as to which is earlier body-knower or the body itself? Because without earlier existence of the knowable body there can not be knower of the same and if the earlier existence of the body is accepted, then the knower of the same would be reduced as non-eternal. When there is no other doer whose witness is he? How be there the variations of painful sensation in one devoid of abnormality? O Lord! Out of the 3- past, present and future- which of the painful sensations of the patient is treated by physician? The reason of the doubt is that the future one has not yet reached, the past one has already passed and the present one also is not stationary. What is the cause of the sensation and its substratum? Where do all these sensations cease completely? By what signs is known the omniscient, detached from all, free from all the conjunctions, one, calm, the self of the creatures? Having heard the queries of Agnivesa, Punarvasu, the best among the wise and with calm self, replied properly in respect of all of them.</p>

<p>The aggregate of 5 mahabhutas and consciousness as the 6th one is known as &quot;Purusa&quot; (person). Consciousness alone is also known as &quot;Purusa&quot;.</p>
<p>Sa1#16</p>
<p>Again from division of constituents he is known as possessing 24 entities such as mind, 10 sense organs, 5 sense objects, and prakrti (matter) consisting of 8 entities (Ayakta, mahat, ahankara and 5 tanmatras).</p>
<p>Sa1#17</p>
<p>Mind is defined as: the entity which , even on contact with self, sense organs and sense objects, is responsible for production or otherwise of knowledge by it&#x27;s attending or non-attending respectively. Subtleness and oneness are known as 2 qualities of mind.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="sa118-19">Sa1#18-19<a href="#sa118-19" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Sa1#18-19" title="Direct link to Sa1#18-19" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The object of thinking, analyzing, reasoning, meditating, determination and whatever, is to be perceived by mind is its object.</p>
<p>Action of mind consists of : control over senses, self-restraint, reasoning, analyzing.</p>
<p>Beyond that is the jurisdiction of buddhi (intellect).</p>
<p>Sa1#20-21</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="processing-information">[Processing Information:]<a href="#processing-information" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to [Processing Information:]" title="Direct link to [Processing Information:]" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The sense-object is received by sense organs along with mind. Then the mind analyses it in forms of merits or demerits and forwards it to Buddhi (intellect) which produces decisive knowledge by which one proceeds to speak or to do something with full knowledge.</p>
<p>Sa1#22-23</p>
<p>The 5 sense organs are composed of 5 mahabhutas (Akasa etc.) with predominance of one in each. They are known by inference through their actions and it is they on the basis of which intelligence proceeds.</p>
<p>Sa1#24</p>
<p>Likewise, motor organs are also 5 in number such as : hands, feet, anus, genitals, and organ of speech. The feet are responsible for movement from one place to another, anus and genitals are meant for discharging, hands for receiving and holding. Tongue represents the organ of speech. The true speech is light while false speech is darkness.</p>
<p>Sa1#25-26</p>
<p>The (5) mahabhutas are akasa, vayu, agni, ap and prthivi. Sound, touch, vision, taste and smell are their properties respectively.</p>
<p>Sa1#27</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="mahabhutas-elements">[{Maha}Bhutas (Elements):]<a href="#mahabhutas-elements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to [{Maha}Bhutas (Elements):]" title="Direct link to [{Maha}Bhutas (Elements):]" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>* Out of them, the 1st one has only one property and there is addition of one property in each of the latter bhutas. Thus the former bhuta along with it&#x27;s property is associated with the latter one.</p>
<p>Sa1#28</p>
<p>* Coarseness, liquidity, mobility, hotness and non-interruption are the specific characters of prthivi, ap, vayu, tejas and akasa respectively. All these characters are perceivable by the tactile sense organ because touch along with it&#x27;s absence is known by the tactile sense organ.</p>
<p>Sa1#29-30</p>
<p>Thus the properties and the characters (in the body) of these which possess properties (dravyas) are mentioned.</p>
<p>The sense objects, sound etc. are known as artha (sense objects). &quot;Gocara&quot;, &quot;visaya&quot; and &quot;guna&quot; are it&#x27;s synonyms.</p>
<p>Sa1#31</p>
<p>The intellect is recognized by the sense organ based on which it emanates. That emanated through mind is known as &quot;manobhava&quot; (emanated through mind). Due to contact of each of the self, sense3 organs, mind and sense object and according to difference of the act, sense organs and objects, there are numerous products of intellect. As the sound produced by the contact of finger and the surface of the thumb and also by that of wiry violin and nails varies numerously so is the product of intellect emanated from the contacts.</p>
<p>Sa1#32-34</p>
<p>The para (avyakta– the primordial unmanifest) holds the conjunction of intellect, sense organs, mind and sense objects. The aggregate of 24 entities is known as &quot;Purusa&quot; (the person).</p>
<p>Sa1#35</p>
<p>The person associated with (predominant) rajas and tamas has endless conjunction of this type but when these 2 are subdued with the predominance of Sata, the conjunction ceases to exist.</p>
<p>Sa1#36</p>
<p>Here are dependent the action, fruit (of action), knowledge and ignorance, pleasure and pain, life and death and ownership. He, who knows this in reality, knows destruction and creation, (continuity of) tradition, therapeutics and whatever else is worth knowing.</p>
<p>Sa1#37-38</p>
<p>There can not be light, darkness, truth, falsehood, scripture, auspicious and inauspicious actions if there be not the active and intelligent person. There would be no substratum (body), happiness, misery, going and coming, speech, understanding, treatises, life and death, knowledge and emancipation if the person were not there. That is why the person is recognized as the cause by the experts in (theory of) causation. If there be no self, light etc. would be causeless; they can not be perceived nor can they serve any purpose.</p>
<p>Sa1#39-42</p>
<p>&quot;The pitcher is made from earth, stick and wheel without the potter&quot;, &quot;the house is constructed with mud, straw and wood without the mason&quot; he who says like this can say the body as made of the instrumental organs in combination without any agent but such statement would only show the ignorance of that man because of being devoid of reasoning and scriptural support.</p>
<p>Sa1#43-44</p>
<p>The personal self is known as the cause from all the sources of valid knowledge and also all the scriptures from which the knowables are known.</p>
<p>Sa1#45</p>
<p>By the continuous process of transformation other similar new products are evolved which are not in the original identity but because of similarity are taken as the same. The aggregate of these entities without any master is the living being. Thus the personal self is neither the doer nor the enjoyer (of the action). This is the view held by certain scholars.</p>
<p>Sa1#46-47</p>
<p>In view of those who do not recognize the self, the other similar new products would enjoy the fruits of action done by their other predecessors.</p>
<p>Sa1#48</p>
<p>(In fact) there may be difference in instrumental organs of the doer but the doer is the same all along. The doer equipped with instruments becomes the cause of all actions. -Sa1#49</p>
<p>The time taken in destruction of an entity is shorter even than the twinkling of eye, the destroyed entities do not re-emerge and one&#x27;s action would not fructify in another, this is the view held by the knowers of reality. On this basis the personal self, the eternal one, is regarded as cause of the living beings in their actions and enjoyment (of their fruits). -Sa1#50-51</p>
<p>In living beings, ego, fruit (of action), action, migration to the body, memory– these are justified only if there be a cause different from the body. -Sa1#52</p>
<p>The supreme self, because of being eternal, has no source of origin while the personal self, being the aggregate (of several entities) is born of ignorance, desire and aversion. -Sa1#53</p>
<p>The self possesses knowledge which comes forth on conjunction with instruments and does not come forth in the condition of their impurity or in absence of their contact. As there is no vision (of image) in a dirty mirror or muddy water even though one sees through, (there is no perception) if the mind etc. are damaged. -SA1#54-55</p>
<p>These instruments are mind, intellect, sense organs and motor organs. The action of the doer emanates from conjunction and so the sensation and the perception. The personal self alone does not incline to action nor does he enjoy the fruit. It is all due to conjunction in absence of which there is nothing. -Sa1#56-57</p>
<p>The existence of an entity is not caused by a single factor nor it is cause-less. However, the non-existence is (not perceptible) due to quick moving and because of natural (inevitable) fate the non-existence does not presuppose a cause. Sa1#58</p>
<p>The self which is beginning-less is eternal but that which is a product of a cause is contrary (non-eternal). One which is not caused is ever-existing and eternal while that which is caused is otherwise. -Sa1#59</p>
<p>That (eternal) is imperceptible to a caused entity because the eternality can&#x27;t be grasped by the same. That is why one which can&#x27;t be grasped is said as unmanifest otherwise manifest. The self which is the knower of the body, eternal, omnipresent and indestructible is the unmanifest. Contrary to that is the manifest one. Both will be described further. The manifest or aindriyaka (pertaining to sense organs) is that which is perceived by the sense organs. Contrary to that is unmanifest which can be known only by certain signs and transcends all senses.</p>
<p>Sa1#60-62</p>
<p>Akasa etc. (akasa, vayu, tejas, ap and prthvi), buddhi (mahat- intellect), avyakta (the unmanifest primordial nature) and ahankara (ego), the 8th one, constitute bhutaprakrti (original source of all creatures). Vikaras (producst) are 16– 5 sense organs, 5 motor organs, mind and 5 objects (bhutas).</p>
<p>Sa1#63-64 [This information is described with nice charts in the 1st chapter of Dr. Lad&#x27;s book &quot;The Science of Self-Healing&quot;. Dr. Lad spent a considerable amount of time discussing these ideas in his classes.]</p>
<p>This (aggregate) except the unmanifest one is known as ksetra (body). The unmanifest one is known as the knower of this body by the sages.</p>
<p>Sa1#65</p>
<p>From the unmanifest (primordial nature) intellect evolves, then ego comes forth, from ego 5 bhutas emanate in order. Thus evolved and complete with all the organs the person is born and is said as emerged.</p>
<p>Sa1#66</p>
<p>At the time of dissolution, the self gets detached from these enjoyable entities. Thus (the self), subdued by rajas and tamas, gets manifested from the unmanifest state and then reverts to the unmanifest and thus moves continuously like a wheel (from one state to another). Thos3e who are attached excessively to duals and are engrossed by ego are subjected to origin and destruction but not others who are contrary to them.</p>
<p>Sa1#67-69</p>
<p>Inspiration and expiration (respiration), twinkling of eye etc. (reflexes), biological functions, psychic [[mental?]] movements, shifting from one sense organ to another, impulsion and restraint (of mind), mentally arriving at another country, sound sleep as if one is dead, perception of an object by left eye which is received by right eye, desire, aversion, happiness, misery, will, consciousness, control, knowledge, memory and ego– these are the signs of the self. As these signs are found only in living beings and not in dead ones, the sages have said them as the signs of the self. After His departure, the body is converted to a lifeless, vacant house and is said to have reached the &quot;fiveness&quot; because of only 5 mahabhutas remaining there.</p>
<p>Sa1#70-74</p>
<p>Mind is unconscious but active while the self kindles consciousness (but is inactive). The omnipresent one becomes active only when it comes in contact with mind. The self is said as &quot;doer&quot; because of having consciousness while mind, devoid of consciousness, is not taken as such in spite of his activeness.</p>
<p>Sa1#75-76</p>
<p>Only the self leads himself to all the species of life, none also is his master. Sa1#77</p>
<p>The self is all powerful (free) to initiate some action but is obliged to enjoy it&#x27;s fruit. The powerful [person/ yogi/ the Self] can concentrate his mind and can also renunciate all.</p>
<p>Sa1#78</p>
<p>The self, though omnipresent, when puts on a body becomes restricted to his own tactile sense organ. That is why he is incapable of perceiving all senses and those pertaining to all bodies.</p>
<p>Sa1#79</p>
<p>The self is omnipres3ent because he is all-pervasive and great. Hence if he concentrates his mind he can perceive even the hidden (object). That associated for ever with mind in accordance with the action of the body should be taken as pervading all species even though (apparently) stationed in one species.</p>
<p>Sa1#80-81</p>
<p>There is no beginning of the self and the continuity of the (created) body. Hence, both being beginningless, it is impossible to say which is earlier.</p>
<p>Sa1#82</p>
<p>Only the one having knowledge can be witness not the ignorant one that is why the self is said as an observer. All the entities of all the living beings are observed by the self.</p>
<p>Sa1#83</p>
<p>** The single self can not be perceived by the signs because the single and the imperceptible has no distinguishing character. Nevertheless, the aggregate self has got differentiation due to sensations. Where there is sensation, differentiation is caused by it. Sa1#84-85</p>
<p>That physician treats all the painful conditions in all the 3 times (past, present and future) is held by certain scholars with the reasoning which may be understood (by you). &quot;Again that headache (came)&quot;, &quot;That fever relapsed&quot;, &quot;That severe cough has recurred&quot;- by such popular statements the recurrence of the past (disorders) is indicated. *&quot;The time for recurrence of the past disorders has approached&quot; considering this when a physician applies remedy at that time to avert the recurrence, it is said as alleviation of past sufferings. ** [interesting statement/ concept.]</p>
<p>The floods which damaged the crop earlier may not come again with this view as bundh [a type of dam/ wall] is constructed so is the preventive treatment in the body. The treatment which is adopted after observing the premonitory symptoms of the wouldbe disorder (in order to prevent it), in fact, averts the future suffering.</p>
<p>By following the code of health the continued association of the suffering ceases and happiness (health) comes forth. &quot;The dhatus which are in balanced state do not go into imbalance and vice versa. They are produced according to the cause&quot;– according to this reasoning the physician treats the suffering of all the 3 times.</p>
<p>Sa1#86-93</p>
<p>The supreme treatment is that which is devoid of allurement. Allurement is the greatest cause of misery and the abode of miseries (body) and renunciation of all allurements eliminates all miseries. ** As silkworm brings forth threads leading to it&#x27;s own death, the ignorant and ever-ill person creates allurement from the sense objects.</p>
<p>One who is wise enough to identify <strong>the fire-like sense objects</strong> and readily withdraws from them, is not attacked by miseries due to absence of initiation and conjunction. * Sa1#94-97</p>
<p>Derangement of intellect, restraint, and memory; advent of time and action and contact with unsuitable sense objects should be known as the causes of misery.</p>
<p>Sa1#98</p>
<p>* Adherence to wrong discrimination between eternal and non-eternal as well as wholesome and unwholesome is known as derangement of intellect because by nature the intellect sees rightly.</p>
<p>Sa1#99</p>
<p>* Due to derangement of restraint it is not possible to control the mind indulged in sensual pleasures from the unwholesome object because the function of restraint is to control.</p>
<p>Sa1#100</p>
<p>When on covering of the self by rajas and tamas the recollection of the knowledge of reality is impaired, it is known as derangement of memory because the thing to be recollected is deposited in memory.</p>
<p>Sa1#101</p>
<p>The unwholesome action performed by one whose intellect, restraint and memory are deranged is known as intellectual error. It vitiates all the dosas. (forcible) Propulsion of urges or their suppression, indulgence in exertive actions and women, excessive or delayed action, wrong initiation of actions, disappearance of modesty and good conduct, rebuking the respected ones, use of unwholesome things though already known as such, use of the factors causing severe derangement of mind, movement in wrong place and time, friendship with the wicked, avoidance of the code of noble conduct described in the chapter on introductory description of senses; envy, conceit, fear, anger, greed, ignorance, narcosis and confusion, troublesome action taken under their spell, troublesome bodily action and other such action arisen from rajas and tamas is said as intellectual error by the nobles which is the cause of diseases.</p>
<p>Sa1#102-108</p>
<p>Wrong understanding by the intellect and wrong actions (accordingly) should be known as intellectual error which is committed by mind.</p>
<p>Sa1#109</p>
<p>** Genesis of diseases due to time factor is already said in the chapter on enumeration of disorders and also accumulation, aggravation and pacification of P etc. [the doshas]. The seasons ending with the rainy one having characters as perverted, excessive or undermined which are cause of disorders, timely and untimely condition of food having been digested, ingested and being digested, 3 divisions of day– forenoon, midday and afternoon, similar ones [3 divisions] of the night– the diseases related to these times are known as caused by time factor.</p>
<p>Sa1#110-112</p>
<p>* (For instance) various forms of malarial fever such as quotidian, severe tertian[,] tertian and quartan, arise in their respective times because they attain strength in those particular times.</p>
<p>Sa1#113</p>
<p>These and other various time-caused diseases should be treated before they arise with due consideration of their strength and time.</p>
<p>Sa1#114</p>
<p>By the succession of time, natural disorders caused by old age and approaching death occur because nature can not be counteracted.</p>
<p>Sa1#115</p>
<p>The deed of the past life known as &quot;daiva&quot; (fate) is also observed as the cause of diseases in (particular) time.</p>
<p>Sa1#116</p>
<p>* There is no major action the fruit of which is not enjoyed. The diseases caused by the deeds (of past life) neutralize the therapeutic measures and subside only on destruction of the deeds.</p>
<p>Sa1#117</p>
<p>Unsuitable use of the sense objects is of 3 categories: insufficient use, over-use, and wrong use. This will vitiates the doshas.</p>
<p>Sa1#118-126</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="unsuitable-use-of-the-senses"><strong>Unsuitable Use of the Senses:</strong><a href="#unsuitable-use-of-the-senses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to unsuitable-use-of-the-senses" title="Direct link to unsuitable-use-of-the-senses" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<table><thead><tr><th>Sense:</th><th>Wrong Use/ Conjunction:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sound</td><td>By hearing intense sound, no sound or too feeble sound, the auditory sense organ is<br>deranged. The contact of the ear with harsh, frightening, inauspicious, disliked and<br>mishap-denoting sound is known as perverted conjunction.</td></tr><tr><td>Touch</td><td>The lack of touch, excessive or diminished touch of the objects, in brief, deranges<br>the tactile sense organ. Touch of the organisms, poisonous winds and untimely<br>touch of the uncting substance, cold and hot [[measures]] is known as the perverted<br>conjunction.</td></tr><tr><td>Sight</td><td>By excessive gazing at brilliant objects, looking at very minute object and not seeing<br>[not looking at all] at all, the visual sense organ is damaged. Looking at disliked,<br>fierce, loathsome, distant, too near and dark objects is known as the perverted<br>conjunction.</td></tr><tr><td>Taste</td><td>Excessive or avoidance of intake, faulty intake, in respect of habitual suitability etc.<br>and little intake of food is harmful.</td></tr><tr><td>Smell</td><td>Inhaling too mild or too irritant odors or completely abstaining from them injures<br>olfactory sense organ. The contact with fetid, infested with organism and poisonous<br>and disliked smells and also with those which are unseasonal.</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>That which is not suited to the person is known as &quot;asatmya&quot; (unsuitable). Sa1#127</p>
<p>The disease arisen due to perverted, excessive and diminished use of sound etc. is known as &quot;Aindriyaka&quot; (related to sense organs).</p>
<p>Sa1#128</p>
<p>These are the cause of painful sensations [the cause of disease-induced pain] . The cause of happiness (health) is only one– balanced use (of the senses) which is very rare.</p>
<p>Sa1#129</p>
<p>Neither the sense organs nor the sense objects are the causes of happiness and misery but the 4-fold use (of senses). (This is proved by the reasoning that) in spite of the existence of sense organs and sense objects, if there be no use there will be neither misery or happiness hence the 4-fold use itself is the cause.</p>
<p>Sa1#130-131</p>
<p>In fact, there can not be happiness or misery without the self, sense organs[,] mind, intellect, sense objects or the past deeds. This is being explained here.</p>
<p>Sa1#132</p>
<p>The contact with the tactile sense organ and that with mind– this 2-fold contact gives rise to pleasant and painful sensations.</p>
<p>Sa1#133</p>
<p>Happiness and misery give rise to allurement in the guise of desire and aversion, the allurement, in turn, acts as cause of happiness and misery. It collects the entities which offer resort to sensations. If there be no collection of entities, there can not be contact and without contact the sensations can not be felt.</p>
<p>Sa1#134-135</p>
<p>The location of sensations is mind, the body equipped with sense organs except head hairs, body hears, tip of nail, ingested food, excreta, fluids and sense objects.</p>
<p>Sa1#136</p>
<p>* All sensations cease to exist in the state of yoga (union with self) and Moksa (emancipation). In moksa, the cessation is complete while yoga leads to that.</p>
<p>Sa1#137</p>
<p>Happiness and misery arise due to contact of the self, sense organs, mind and the sense objects but when the mind is steadily concentrated to the self, both cease to exist due to non-initiation and a supernatural power comes forth into the person. This state is known as &quot;yoga&quot; by the expert sages.</p>
<p>Sa1#138-139</p>
<p>Entering into other&#x27;s body, knowledge of other&#x27;s mind, doing things at pleasure, supernatural vision, supernatural hearing, superhuman memory, superhuman brilliance and disappearance at pleasure– these 8 are said as supernatural powers of yogis. All this is possible only due to concentration of pure mind (in the self).</p>
<p>Sa1#140-141</p>
<p>Moksa (emancipation) is possible by absence of rajas and tamas, destruction of the potent past deeds and detachment from all the (sources of) conjunction. It is also said as absence of rebirth.</p>
<p>Sa1#142</p>
<p>Keeping in touch with the saints, avoidance of the ignobles, observance of vows, fasting and other rules, study of religious scriptures, understanding, attachment to lonely places and detachment from worldly pleasure, effort for emancipation, great restraint, non-initiation of action, destruction of past deeds, inclination to getting out, from ego, realizing fear in conjunction [what does this mean?], concentration of mind and body, critical analysis of the philosophical reality– all this arises due to emergence of the memory of reality (which leads to emancipation).</p>
<p>Sa1#143-146</p>
<p>Memory [of the Self] comes forth by the factors beginning with keeping in touch with the saints and ending with restraint. After emergence of memory one gets rid off misery by recollecting the nature of created beings.</p>
<p>Sa1#147</p>
<p>(Now I) will mention the 8 factors which help in emergence of memory. These are– perception of the cause, perception of the form, similarity, contrast, predominance of sattwa, practice, constant thinking and repeated hearing. Memory is defined as recollection of seen, heard and experienced things.</p>
<p>Sa1#148-149</p>
<p>The power of recollection of the reality is the only way to emancipation as shown by the emancipated ones, by which one having gone never returns. This is said as the way to yoga by yogins as well as the philosophers having accurate knowledge of the virtues and as that of emancipation by the emancipated ones.</p>
<p>Sa1#150-151</p>
<p>All caused is (source of) misery, dependent and non-eternal. That is not concerned with the self but only a wrong notion of mine-ness arises until the true knowledge emerges. But hereafter with it&#x27;s help knowing that &quot;I am not this (body)&quot; &quot;this (body) is not mine&quot;, the knower of truth transcends all.</p>
<p>Sa1#152-153</p>
<p>In that state of final renunciation, all sensations with their roots (causes) along with consciousness, knowledge and understanding cease completely.</p>
<p>Sa1#154</p>
<p>** Hereafter the personal self because of being identified as Brahman is not</p>
<p>perceived as being devoid of all entities he possesses no sign. Her there is scope only for the knowers of Brahman and not the ignorant one who is incapable of grasping that. Sa1#155</p>
<p>The absolute self is devoid of abnormality and characters in all beings, hence the characters are found only due to specific features of psyche and body. Sa4#33</p>

<p>There are 3 dosas in body– V, P and K. They affect the body. There are 2 dosas in psyche– rajas and tamas. They affect the psyche when psyche or body or both is/are affected, the morbidity arises otherwise not. -Sa4#34</p>
<p>The psyche is of 3 types– pure(sattvic), rajas and tamasa. The pure is said as devoid of defects due to having beneficial fraction whereas rajasa and tamasa are defective because of the fractions of agitation and ignorance respectively. Out of these 3 types of psyche, each one has got innumerable subdivisions due to relative degrees and variations in interaction of psyche and body according to species. Body follows psyche and vice versa. Hence some of the types of psyche (the 7 sattvic, 6 rajasic and 3 tamasic) are described here as illustrations by showing their similarity with some well-known symbols. Sa4#36</p>
<p>The 2 psychic doshas: Rajas</p>
<p>Tamas -Vi6#5</p>
<p>They cause these disorders: passion, anger, greed, confusion, envy, conceit, narcosis, anxiety, excitement, fear, exhilaration, etc.. -Vi6#5</p>
<p>There is constant association of Rajas and Tamas together, because tamas can&#x27;t move without the help of Rajas. -Vi6#9</p>

<p>Thus the 3 types of sattwa (psyche), though having innumerable variations are described with a partial classification. The pure psyche, on the basis of similarity of the psyche of Brahma, Rsi, Indra, Yama, Varuna, Kubera and Gandharva, has been divided into 7 sub-types; the rajasa psyche on the same basis simulating with that of daitya, pisaca, raksasa, sarpa, preta and sakuni has been divided into 6 sub-types and the tamasa psyche into 3 sub-types according to similarity with psyche of animals, fish and plants.</p>
<p>* The purpose of the descriptions of psyche is to facilitate the treatment of disorders according to the psyche. -Sa4#40</p>

<p>[So] In order to prevent derangements in the sense organs along with mind one should make effort to maintain the normalcy by these methods– such as, with conjunction of wholesome sense objects one should perform acts well properly and invariably examining with intellect, and also by regular use of those which are opposite to qualities of place, time and self.</p>

<p>Lord Punarvasu said– Person is equal to universe. Whatever formed entities are in the universe, the same are in the Person and vice-versa. Having listened thus to Lord</p>
<p>Atreya, Agnivesa said– From this brief statement we are unable to grasp the idea contained in the same, hence we want to hear in more details from you, O Lord! Sa5#3</p>
<p>Lord Atreya replied– The constituents of the universe are innumerable and so of the Person as such I will illustrate certain common entities grossly, hear attentively O Agnivesa! The aggregate of 6 constituents is termed as &quot;universe&quot; (macrocosm) such as– prthivi, ap, tejas, vayu, akasa and unmanifest Brahman (principle of consciousness). These very 6 constituents aggregated are termed as &quot;Person&quot;.</p>
<p>Sa5#4</p>
<p>** In the Person prthivi, ap, tejas, vayu, akasa and brahman are represented by form, moisture, heat, vital breath, pores (including vacant spaces) and inner self respectively. ** As is the magnificence of Brahman in the universe so is that of inner self in the person. * In the universe the greatness of Brahman is represented by Prajapati and in the Person the same of the inner self is represented by the psyche. ** What is Indra in the universe is ego in the person, Aditya (the sun) receiving, Rudra agitation, Soma (the moon) cheerfulness, Vayu happiness, Aswins lustre, Marut enthusiasm, Visvadeva all sense organs and their objects, darkness ignorance, light knowledge; as initial creation in case of the universe so impregnation in the person, krtayuga childhood, treta youth, dwapara old age, kali illness, and end of creation death. Thus by inference commonness of other unmentioned entities of the universe and the person may also be known.</p>
<p>Sa5#5</p>
<p>After Lord Atreya concluded his talk, Agnivesa asked– Whatever your lordship said about commonness between the universe and the person is quite correct.. What is the purpose of describing the commonness [similarities] between them?</p>
<p>Sa5#6</p>
<p>Lord Atreya said– O Agnivesa! listen to me. Seeing the entire universe in the Self and vice versa gives rise to true knowledge. On seeing the entire universe in his Self one realizes the truth that self alone is the agent of happiness and misery and none else. Though associated with cause etc. under the influence of previous actions, after realizing the identity of the Self with the universe, he rises for salvation. Here the word &quot;Loka&quot; denotes combination, ordinarily the entire universe is the aggregate of 6 constituents.</p>
<p>Sa5#7</p>
<p>It has got a hetu [cause] and stages of transformation such as utpatti, vrddhi, upaplava and viyoga. Hetu is the cause of birth; utpatti is the birth, vrddhi is growth and development, upaplava is advent of afflictions and viyoga is disjunctino of the 6 constituents also known as passing away of the life-principle, cessation of vital breath, breaking away, reverting to the natural state. The root cause of the universe as well as the advent of all miseries is inclination to worldly affairs while going away from them leads to their cessation. Inclination is misery and disinclination is happiness. This knowledge, which comes forth, is true. This is possible from the knowledge of the commonness with the entire universe. This is the purpose of describing the commonness.</p>
<p>Sa5#8</p>
<p>Thereafter Agnivesa further put the query– what is the source of inclination, what</p>
<p>are the means for disinclination? O Lord! Sa5#9</p>
<p>Lord Atreya replied– the source of inclination are: ignorance, desire, aversion and action. Inclination, in turn, gives rise to ahankara, sanga, samsaya, abhisamplava, abhyavapata, vipratyaya, avisesa and anupaya which overcoming the person engulf him due to which he becomes unable to transcend the worldly existence like a tender tree subdued by big and excessively branching trees. [These will now be described.]</p>
<p>Ahankara (ego)- is the feeling that &quot;I belong to such high clan and possess excellence of wealth, conduct, intellect, modesty, learning, fame, age, prowess and influence.&quot;</p>
<p>Sanga (attachment)-- consists of the mental, vocal or physical actions which are not conducive to emancipation.</p>
<p>Samsaya (doubt)-- such as the result of the past deeds, emancipation, persons and after-life exist or not.</p>
<p>Abhisamplava– is the wrong identity of the Self with the body when the person feels that in all conditions there is none else than myself, I am the creator, I am perfect by nature and I am the aggregate of body, sense organs, intellect and memory.</p>
<p>Abhayavapata– is the sense of ownership or self-based attachment such as mother, father, brother, wife, children, kins, friends and servants are mine and I am theirs.</p>
<p>Vipratyaya– is the opposite thinking between worth doing and otherwise wholesome-unwholesome, beneficial-nonbeneficial.</p>
<p>Avisesa– is the lack of distinction between conscious and unconscious, original source and products, inclination and disinclination.</p>
<p>Anupaya– is the employment of inefficient means such as proksana (consecration), anasana (fasts), agnihotra (fire worship), trisavana (worship with soma 3 times a day), abhyuksana (wetting), avahana (invocation), yajana (guiding sacrifices), yacana (begging), entering into water and fire.</p>
<p>Thus the person devoid of intellect, restraint and memory, engrossed in egoism, attachment, wrong identity, self-based attachment, opposite thinking and lack of discrimination adopts wrong course and thus becomes like an abode-tree for all the miseries caused by the defects of the psyche and the body. In this way, being moved around by the defects like egoism etc. he is unable to transcend the path of inclination which is the root of all sins.</p>
<p>-all of the above Sa5#10</p>
<p>Disinclination is &quot;apavarga&quot; (emancipation), this is also known as the Supreme, Highest bliss, identity with the unchangeable Brahman and freedom from bondage. Sa5#11</p>
<p>Now (I) shall mention the means for ascending for those desiring emancipation: One who sees defects in the worldly affairs and desires emancipation should follow the following path in right earnest– submission to the teacher, implementing he instructions, exclusive service to the fire, going through the religious codes, understanding their ideas, clinging to them and performing actions accordingly, keeping company with saints, avoiding the wicked abstaining from the company of the mean, speaking words true, beneficial to all, aunharsh, timely and after careful examination, longing and talking with all types of women, renouncing all acquisitions, loin cloth for covering up (the private parts), clothings dyed with red ochre, having a needle case for sewing the robes, water</p>
<p>pot for cleansing, holding a staff, having a bowl for begging, meal only once of undomestic (wild grains) as availed just to sustain life, bedding and pillow of rotten, dry leaves and grasses for alleviating fatigue, binding of body (in a particular posture) for meditation, living in forest homelessly, avoiding drowsiness, sleep, lassitude etc., restraining the sense of liking and affliction to sense objects, inclination with prior recollection to sleeping, standing, going, looking, eating, sporting, movements of body parts etc., dispassionate to honor, praise, despise and insult, tolerance to sensation of hunger, thirst, exertion, fatigue, cold, hot, wind, rains, happiness and misery, not moved by grief, dejection, conceit, agitation, vanity, greed, attachment, envy, fear, anger, etc., taking ego etc,. as complication, observing commonness in creation etc. of the universe and the self; fear of passing away of the opportune moment, not being dejected in the practice of yoga, invigorating the psyche, potentiating intellect, restraint and memory for emancipation, concentration of sense organs in mind, of mind in the Self and of the very Self; frequently analyzing the body parts according to constituents, realizing that all caused is painful, not own and non-eternal, taking all inclinations as sin, considering renunciation of all as happiness. This is the way to salvation otherwise to bondage. Thus described the means for ascending (to the path of emancipation).</p>
<p>Sa5#12</p>
<p>Here are the verses–</p>
<p>The dirty psyche gets cleaned by these means like a mirror by oil, cloth, brush etc. then the psyche, being purified shines like the solar disc uncovered by any other planets, clouds, dust, smoke and fog. That psyche concentrated into the self with all doors closed illumines like the lamp situated in the lamp case, pure, stable and with pleasant light.</p>
<p>Sa5#13-15</p>
<p>The pure and true knowledge comes forth from the pure mind by which the tamas (darkness), very strong and consisting of great ignorance, is dispelled; one becomes free from desires by knowing nature of all beings, yoga is accomplished and sankhya is attained; one does not get affected by ego, does not get attached to the cause (of miseries), does not hold anything rather renounces all; Brahman, the eternal, unchangeable, blissful, indestructible, is attained, that is known by the synonyms vidya (learning), siddhi (accomplishment), mati (thinking), medha (intelligence), prajna (higher intellect) and jnana (knowledge).</p>
<p>Sa5#16-19</p>
<p>When one thinks himself spread in the universe and vise versa, and has the vision of the great and the small (mundane affairs), his serenity based on knowledge is not affected.</p>
<p>Sa5#20</p>
<p>When one sees always all the entities in all conditions has become identical with Brahman, is pure and does not get entrapped by (the forces of) the combination (which is the cause of miseries).</p>
<p>Sa5#21</p>
<p>At this stage, even the signs of the Self are also not found because He is devoid of all the instruments (sense organs) and because of the lack of contact with the senses, He is called as emancipated.</p>
<p>Sa5#22</p>
<p>Moksa or Santi (the highest bliss) is known by the synonyms– vipapa (free from sins), virajas (free from rajas), santa (blissful), para (the great), aksara (unchangeable), avyaya (indestructible), amrta (immortal), Brahman (God) and nirvana (extinction).</p>
<p>O gentle! This is the specific knowledge by acquiring which the sages free from doubts and devoid of tamas, rajas and desires; attained perfect serenity.</p>
<p>Sa5#23-24</p>
<p>Description of commonness between the universe and the Self along with the purpose, the cause of inclination and the path of disinclination, concentration of pure psyche, true knowledge leading to the final object (emancipation) and the final object (emancipation) itself– all this is said by the great sage in this chapter on the detailed knowledge about the person.</p>

<p>&quot;the year is divided into 2, 3, 6, 12, or even more parts according to the nature of action (to be taken). Now, dividing it into 6, the action will be said&quot;: Hemanta (early winter), Grisma (summer) and varsa (rainy season) these are the 3 seasons characterized by cold, heat and rains [respectively].</p>
<p>In between them are other 3 seasons having common characters such as Pravrt (early rains), sarad (autumn) and vasanta (spring). Pravrt denotes the early rains, varsa is the continuation of the same. &quot;<em>Thus these 6 divisions of seasons have been made for the purpose of evacuative therapy&quot;</em> - This whole block: Vi8#125</p>

<p>2)Middle age: (up to 60 yrs.) Characterized by strength, energy, virility, prowess, acquisition, retention, recollection, speech, understanding, and qualities of all dhatus having reached the normal limit; with proper physical and mental strength, without degeneration in qualities of dhatus, with predominance of P.</p>
<p>3)Old age: (up to 100 yrs) Dhatus, sense organs, strength, energy, virility, prowess, acquisition, retention, recollection, speech, and understanding gradually degenerate, qualities of dhatus go down and there is predominance of V. The measure of life-span is 100 yrs. &quot;There are persons who live longer or shorter than that, in such cases, one should determine the three divisions of age on the basis of strength of factors like Prakrti etc. (except vikrti) and also characters of different periods of lifespan&quot;. -Vi8#122</p>

<p>One&#x27;s diet (of various types) leads to promotion of strength and complexion only if he knows the wholesomeness according to the different seasons dependent on behavior and diet.</p>
<p>Su6#3</p>
<p>Here, the year has 6 parts according to division in seasons.</p>
<p>Amongst them the (period of) 3 seasons– from sisira to grisma– is known as adana (receiving) when the sun takes northward course;</p>
<p>(The period of the other 3 seasons) from varsa to hemanta is visarga (releasing) with the sun following its southward course.</p>
<p>Su6#4</p>
<p>In the period of visarga winds are not very rough as in adana; soma (moon) having unobstructed strength replenishes the world continuously with it&#x27;s cold rays, thus visarga is saumya (having predominance of soma).</p>
<p>On the other hand, adana is agneya (predominant in agni).</p>
<p>Thus the sun, the wind and the moon are responsible for appearance of time, season, rasa, dosa and bodily strength according to the nature and course of time they follow.</p>
<p>Su6#5</p>
<p>(During the period of adana) the sun receiving the unctuous portion of nature, and the wind– sharp and rough drying it up produce roughness in sisira, vasanta and grisma in progressive order and by increasing tikta, kasaya and katu having roughness cause debility in human beings.</p>
<p>Su6#6</p>
<p>While in varsa, sarad and hemanta when the sun in facing towards south with it&#x27;s intensity having been attuned by time, course, clouds, winds and rains; the moon is having unobstructed strength and the temperature of the nature having been cooled down by heavenly waters, the non-rough rasas– amla, lavana and madhura– increase in progressive order with the consequent promotion of strength in human beings.</p>
<p>Su6#7</p>
<p>Here it is–</p>
<p>The human beings experience debility in beginning and end, medium strength in mid-term and maximum strength in end and beginning of the periods, visarga and adana, respectively.</p>
<p>Su6#8</p>
<p>During the cold hemanta (winter), in strong persons, the agni (digestion), as checked by the contact of cold wind, becomes stronger and capable of consuming even the articles heavy in quantity as well as nature [quality; i.e., cheese, beef...]. Hence, when it (agni) does not get proper fuel (diet), <strong>it absorbs the bodily rasa that is why the cold V is vitiated during the cold season</strong>. So during hemanta, one should use the unctuous, sour and salted juice of the meat of dominantly fatty aquatic and marshy animals and also meat of burrow-dwelling and prasaha (who eat by snatching) types of animals. After [eating ] this [meal] the person should drink [an after-drink of] wine, vinegar and honey. One does not lose life-span if he takes regularly milk products, cane sugar products, fats, oil, new rice and hot water during hemanta. One should use massage, anointing, head oil, heated chamber, sun, heated rooms above and underground. During cold season, one should use carriages, beds and seats well-covered and spread over with heavy sheets made of wool, silk, skin, hair-braids and variegated blankets. The clothes should be heavy and warm and he should apply thick paste of aguru [a warming aromatic herb, perhaps similar to cinnamon or hina oil] on his body. While on bed, he</p>
<p>should sleep, embracing well-developed women having: big and prominent breasts and anointed the body with aguru paste, with exhilaration and libido and enjoy sexual intercourse up to full satisfaction at the advent of sisira. When winter begins, one should avoid V-increasing and light food and drinks, restricted diet, strong winds and intake of cold drinks.</p>
<p>Su6#9-18</p>
<p>Hemanta and sisira are similar with the slight difference that the latter has more roughness due to beginning of adana and cold due to clouds, winds and rains. Hence the entire routine of living prescribed for hemanta is applicable to sisira as well. During sisira, one should reside in a house which is more wind-free and heated. During sisira, one should avoid pungent, bitter, astringent, light, cold and V-increasing food and drinks. Su6#19-21</p>
<p>During spring, the accumulated K irritated by the strong rays of the sun disturbs the body-heat and thus causes many diseases. Hence, during spring, evacuative measures like vomiting etc. should be applied and heavy, sour, fatty and sweet diet as well as daysleep should be avoided. One should use regularly during blossoming of flowers (spring) physical exercise, anointing, smoking, gargles, collyrium and bath etc. with warm water. He should use paste of sandal and aguru on the body and diet mainly consisting of barley and wheat [barley and wheat, not kitchadi!]. During spring, one should eat meat of sasrabha (wapiti), sasa (rabbit), ena (antelope), lava (common quail) and kapinjala (grey partridge) and drink harmless vinegars and wines. Therefore, he should enjoy the blossoming beauty of women and forests.</p>
<p>Su6#22-26</p>
<p>During summer, the sun, with his rays, draws up excessively the moisture of the nature hence in that season, sweet, cold, liquid and fatty food and drinks are beneficial. The person taking regular cold and sweet mantha (unctuous drink), meat of wild animals and birds, ghee and milk along with rice does not suffer during summer. Wine should be taken in a little quantity or with plenty of water or should be avoided altogether. Salted, sour, pungent and hot (food) and also physical exercise should be avoided. One should take sleep in cool room during the day and on the top (roof) of the mansion with abundant air and cooled with moon rays during night, having pasted sandal on his body. One adorned with pearls and gems should take seat having been attended with fans and hand touch which are cooled with sandal water. During summer, one should resort to forests, cold water and flowers avoiding sexual intercourse altogether.</p>
<p>Su6#27-32</p>
<p>In the body weakened during adana (period), the digestion becomes poor which is further disturbed by the disorders of V etc. [the doshas] during rainy season. Due to earth vapor, humidity of clouds and sour paka (transformation) of water, the power of digestion is weakened and V etc. are aggravated during the rainy season. Hence, moderate living is recommended for this season. During this period, one should avoid cold drinks, day sleep, dews, river water, physical exercise and sexual intercourse. He should use food and drinks of ten mixed with honey. During rainy season, when the day is filled with winds and rains and is much cooler, diet having predominance of sour, salted and fatty articles should be taken for pacification of V. The person, cautiously protecting his agni,</p>
<p>should eat old barley, wheat and rice along with wild meats and prepared soups. For drinks, wine or other types of fermented liquor mixed with honey and in a little quantity, rain water or water from well or tank, boiled and cooled, should be used. One should use regularly rubbing and anointing of the body, bath, fragrance and garlands, light and clean clothes and should reside in a place which is free from humidity and fit for the rainy season.</p>
<p>Su6#33-40</p>
<p>During autumn, the persons having adjusted to rains and cold are suddenly subjected to the heat of sunrays which leads to aggravation of the accumulated P. In that season, sweet, light, cold, slightly bitter and P-pacifying food and drinks should be taken in proper quantity and with good appetite. During autumn one should take regularly the meats of lava (common quail), kapinjala (gray partridge), ena (antelope), urabhra (sheep), sarabha (wapiti) and sasa (rabbit), rice, barley and wheat. One should prescribe use of bitter ghee formulas, purgatives and blood-letting and avoidance of the sun during the autumn. One should avoid fat, oil, dews, meat of aquatic and marshy animals, alkali, curd, day-sleep and easterly wind. The water, heated with the sunrays during the day and cooled with moonrays during night, cooked by time, free from defects and detoxicated by agastya (a star), is known as &quot;hamsodaka&quot; which is obtained during autumn and is clean and pure. This water is beneficial like nectar if used in bath, drink and plunging. Garlands of seasonal flowers, clean apparel and also the moonrays in early nights are recommended during the autumn season.</p>
<p>Su6#41-48</p>
<p>Thus is said the wholesomeness pertaining to behavior and diet in different seasons.</p>
<p>Su6#49</p>
<p>In every season what is to be used and avoided by the persons is said rationally in the chapter of one&#x27;s diet etc. along with the wholesomeness.</p>

<p>The Charaka (and any good text)contains various ideas, variegated with various sentences pleasing with meanings, possessed with various auspicious words and their unions and capable of defeating opponents in various debates. Vi8#155 Origin of the Charaka Samhita and It&#x27;s Sister Texts:</p>
<p>It was only the extraordinary merit and not the different instruction of the sage that made Agnivesha the author of the compendium [the Charaka Samhita] first.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Bhela etc. also authored their own compendiums and all of them, intelligent ones, presented their works before Atreya along with the group of sages.</p>
<p>The sages, on hearing the composition of benevolent topics were extremely pleased and approved it with the remark that they were properly composed.</p>
<p>All praised them, the benefactors of all creatures, along with the loud applause for the compassion on creatures.</p>
<p>These (loud) virtuous words of the great sages were heard by the godly sages and gods living in heaven and they were extremely delighted.</p>
<p>The deep and affectionate sound of &quot;well done&quot; expressed by the creatures with happiness in the sky resounded the 3 worlds.</p>
<p>The pleasant wind began to blow, all corners blossomed with lustre and there were divine showers of flowers and water.</p>
<p>Then the goddesses of Buddhi (intelligence), Siddhi (success), Smrti (memory), Medha (intellect)j, Dhrti (restraint), Kirti (fame), Ksama (forbearance) and Daya (kindness) entered into Agnivesha etc.</p>
<p>Thus their compendiums approved by the great sages were established on strong footing for the welfare of the creatures.</p>

<p>Bhardwaja, a great ascetic, went to Indra, the god of gods and the savior in quest of longevity. Su1#3</p>
<p>At first, Prajapati received Ayureda in it&#x27;s entirety as propounded by Brahma, therefrom Aswins (received), from Aswins lord Indra received it fully, that is why Bharadwaja, as requested by the sages, came to Indra. Su1#4-5</p>
<p>When diseases cropped up creating impediments in penance, abstinence, study, celibacy, religious observances and life-span of living beings, the holy great sages, out of sympathy on creatures, assembled on one of the auspicious sides of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>Su1#6-7</p>
<p>Among them were Angira, Jamadagni, Vasistha, Kasyapa, Bhrgu, Atreya, Gautama, Sankhya, Pulastya, Narada, Asita, Agastya, Vamadea, Markandeya, Asvalayana, Pariksi, Bhiksu Atreya, Bharadwaja, Kapinjala, Viswamitra, Asmarathya, Bhargava, Cyavana, Abhijit, Gargya, Sandilya, Kaundinya(lya), Varksi, Devala, Galava, Sankrtya, Baijavapi, Kusika, Badarayana, Badisa, Saraloma, Kapya, Katyayana, Kankayana, Kaikaseya, Dhaumya, Marica, Kasyapa, Sarkaraksa, Hiranyaksa, Lokaksa, Paingi, Saunaka, Sakuneya, Maitreya, Maimatayani along with the sages of the Vaikhanasa and Valakhilya orders and other great sages. They all, sources of spiritual knowledge, self control and restraint of mind, illumined with brilliance of penance like fire having done oblations, took their seats comfortably and held auspicious deliberations. Su1#8-14</p>
<p>Disease-free condition is the best source of virtue, wealth, gratification and emancipation while the diseases are destroyers of these same, as well as of welfare and life itself. Now it was apparent that this was a great obstacle for human beings. What could be done? The Sages concentrated on this problem, and with their concentrated vision, they saw Indra as savior. That god of gods is only able to tell the correct means of amelioration. Su1#15-17</p>
<p>The sages asked, who should go to the abode of Indra to inquire about this? First spoke Bharadwaja, &quot;I may will go for this mission&quot; and so he was sent to Indra&#x27;s abode, where he saw the killer of Bala sitting in the midst of the group s of godly sages and glittering like fire. He approached him with felicitating words of praises and blessings and submitted the message of the sages humbly and in the best possible way- &quot;Diseases causing fear in all living beings have appeared, so O Lord of gods, tell me the proper measures for their treatment&quot;. Then Lord Indra, having observed the wide intelligence of the great sage, delivered to him Ayurveda in a few words. Su1#18-23</p>
<p>He Said: &quot;Ayurveda continuing from time immemorial and virtuous was known by Brahma (the creator) first.&quot; Su1#24</p>
<p>Bharadwaja, the intelligent and concentrated sage, acquired the endless and 3 pronged Ayurveda properly and entirely in a short time. By this Bharadwaja attained immeasurable happy life-span and he transmitted that knowledge, as it is- neither more nor less- to the sages. Su1#25-26</p>
<p>The sages, desirous of long life, too received that benevolent Veda (compendium of knowledge) of promoting life-span from Bharadwaja. The great sages further grasped properly the knowledge of samanya (similarity), visesa (dissimilarity), guna (properties), dravya (substance), karma (action) and samavaya (inherence) by which they followed firmly the tenets of the compendium and attained the highest well-being and nonperishable life-span. Su1#27-29</p>
<p>Now Punarvasu, out of friendliness, and prompted with compassion for all creatures, bestowed the virtuous Ayurveda upon his six disciples- Agnivesa, Bhela, Jatukarna, Parasara, harita and Ksarapani. Su1#30-31</p>
<p>It was only the extraordinary merit -and not different instruction- that made Agnivesha the author of the first compendium of Atreya&#x27;s teaching. Afterwards, Bhela and the others also wrote their own texts and all of them, intelligent ones, presented their works before Atreya in the presence of a group of sages. The sages, on hearing the composition of benevolent topics were extremely pleased and approved it with the remark that they were properly composed. All praised them, the benefactors of all creatures, along with the loud applause for the compassion on all creatures. The loud virtuous words of the great sages were heard by the godly sages and gods living in heaven and they were extremely delighted. The deep and affectionate sound of &quot;well done!&quot; expressed by the creatures with happiness in the sky resounded the three worlds. The pleasant wind began to blow, all corners blossomed with lustre and there were divine showers of flowers and water. Then the goddesses of knowledge Buddhi (intelligence), Siddhi (success), Smrti (memory), Medha (intellect), Dhrti (restraint), Kirti (fame), Ksama (forbearance) and Daya (kindness) entered into Agnivesa and the other sages/ disciples. Thus their compendiums approved by the great sages were established on a strong footing for the welfare of all creatures. Su1#32-40</p>
<p>&quot;As the thread holds together the flowers in a necklace, this sutrasthana has been composed by the sage for the collection of various topics.&quot;</p>

Then attending to the fire with the fuel sticks made of palasa, ingudi, udumbara and madhuka while in pure condition and facing eastwards, as prescribed under the method of study, ho should offer oblations of honey and ghee to the fire reciting benedictory mantas first invoking Brahma, Agni, Dhanwantari, Prajapati, Aswins, Indra and sages, the authors of the aphorisms and ending with &quot;swaha&quot; three times each. -Vi8#11</p>
<p>The disciple should follow him. After offering oblations he should go round the fire keeping it to the right side. Then brahmanas should recite &quot;swasti&quot; (mantras promoting well-being). At the end, he should pay respects to the physicians present in the ceremony. Then at this ceremony the physician should instruct the initiate of the code of honor.</p>

<p>you should live with celibacy, keeping beard and mustaches, speaking truth, not eating meat, using pure and intellect-promoting things without envy and</p>
<p>possessing no weapons. You should never disobey my words except in case they lead to king&#x27;s wrath, loss of life, great unrighteousness and other such calamity. You should always surrender to me, regard me as head, be submissive to me and follow the course which is liked by and useful to me. YOU should live with me behaving as son, servant ad suppliant. YOU should move without haughtiness, carefully, with mind concentrated, humbleness and constant vigilance, without jealousy and with my permission. Whether permitted or not tho move out, you should first make effort, as far as possible, to collect things for the teacher. Then you join the medical profession and wish success in work, earnings of wealth, fame and heaven after death, you should always think of the welfare of all the living beings keeping cow and brahmana before. YOU should make effort to provide health to the patients by all means. You should not think ill of the patients even at the cost of your life. You should not approach the others woman and any other&#x27;s property even in imagination. Your dress and accessories should be modest. [&quot;YOU should not be modest.&quot;] YOU should not be addicted to drinking, indulged in sins, and associated with sinners, you should speak smooth, pure, righteous, blissful, thankful, truthful, useful and measured words. YOU should always keep place and time in mind, with good remembrance, striving constantly for knowledge, progress and excellence of equipements, you should never prescribe medicines for those disliked by the king, disliked by wealthy magnets or disliking them and for all those who are excessively diseased, wicked; having troublesome conduct, behavior and management, have not counteracted their censures and one nearing death; and also for the ladies in absence of their husbands or guardians, you should never accept meat offered by the ladies without permission of their husbands or guardian. While entering into the patient&#x27;s house you should take along a known person whose entry is permitted; you should be well-dressed, with head lowered, having good memory, with stillness, thinking carefully and moving accordingly; having entered there, you should not engage your speech, mind and sense organs anywhere except the patient, his well-being and other entities of the patient&#x27;s body respectively. The matters of the patient&#x27;s house should not be disclosed outside, even though you know the diminution in life-span of the patient you should not mention it where it is liable to cause harm to the patient or others. Even though you are learned enough, you should not boast too much for your knowledge because mostly the people become irritated for the excessive boasting even if it comes from and authority. -Vi8#13</p>
<p>There is no end to Ayurveda, hence one should devote himself to is constantly and without any negligence. This is worth doing. One should learn without jealousy excellence of conduct even from the enemies because for the wise the world is teacher while for the unwise it is enemy. Hence the wise, after due consideration, should hear and implement the advice which is thankful, promoting fame, life span, strength and popularity even if it comes from an enemy. Thereafter he should speak thus– you should always behave properly to gods, fire, brahmana, preceptors, elders, accomplished ones and teacher, thus this fire alongwith all the perfumes, eatables, gems and grains and aforesaid gods would bless you with prosperity, otherwise they would curse you. When the teacher has said all this, the disciple should say &quot;yes&quot; (I shall act accordingly). If the disciple follows the instruction then he is to be taught otherwise not. The teacher teaching such a worthy disciple obtains the aforesaid fruits of teaching and enjoins the disciple and himself with other unmentioned beneficial qualities. Thus method of teaching is said.</p>

<p>Discussion with specialists: promotes pursuit and advancement of knowledge, provides dexterity, improves power of speaking, illumines fame, removes</p>
<p>doubt in scriptures, if any, by repeating the topics, and crates confidence in case there is any doubt, and brings forth new ideas. The ideas memorized in study from the teacher, will become firm when applied in (competitive) discussion.</p>
<h1>Vi8#15</h1>
<p>The teacher possesses much secret ,knowledge. When he is pleased with the devoted disciple, gradually he will deliver these ideas. These same are expressed by the disciple with enthusiasm during discussion in order to gain victory. In this way, the careful student earns and retains his teacher&#x27;s knowledge.</p>

<h1>Method of testing another physician&#x27;s knowledge; the 8 Topics for Debate:</h1>
<p>&quot;One physician should, at the very start, <em>(of a discussion with another physician; to test or quiet a quack physician)</em> should ask the other physician about 8 topics:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<ol>
<li class="">treatise, 2) scope of the treatise,</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="">
<ol start="3">
<li class="">section, 4) scope of the section,</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li class="">
<ol start="7">
<li class="">topics, 8) scope of the topics.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The other physician should reply dealing entirely with the subject by means of text, interpretation and recapitulation <em>(if he is a truly good physician)</em>.&quot;</p>

<p>[So basically a physician/ student should challenge his counterpart to recite from memory the latter 7 topics pertaining to one specific text. Then the counterpart should be able to interpret, summarize and give practical examples of any of this information.]</p>

<p>Interrogation is the question on any subject from the treatise according to the accepted procedure. Interpretation of the interrogation is the rational solution of the same on the basis of the treatise. The word &quot;Tantra&quot; is derived from &quot;tantrana&quot; (pervasiveness and protection), &quot;Sthana&quot; from &quot;arthapratistha&quot; (containing the subject well) and the titles of adhyayas (chapters) are based on various topics. Thus according to query, the entire &quot;Astaka&quot; (8 topics) has been explained. In this way, the well-defined subjectmatter of the text has also been said in entirety.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="su3069-71">Su30#69-71<a href="#su3069-71" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Su30#69-71" title="Direct link to Su30#69-71" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>There are persons having partial and superficial informations whose unexpected flying up creates irritation like that of male bustard. Hence, in the beginning of the talk, one should always put the 8 topics with a view to testing the superiority or inferiority because there only the well-versed in scriptures can stand while those knowing a portion of it feel giddy by the very word of the entire treatise like the weak bustards by the sound of bow-string.</p>

<p>Some animal in the midst of the weak ones behaves like a wolf but finding a real</p>
<p>wolf it reverts to it&#x27;s natural position. Likewise, a fool on the basis of his talkativeness, establishes his authority among the fools but is exposed in face of the real authority. Like large brown mongoose hidden in it&#x27;s own woolen bristles, what the fool having no wide knowledge can speak in discussions as a clumsy, dull one. The physician should not come in conflict with men of noble conduct though having little knowledge but should subdue the otherwise posing themselves as authority at the very start with the 8 questions. The fools often are arrogant and talkative speaking too much and irrelevantly while the gentlemen are often good-looking and talking less and relevantly. One, dispassionately, should not tolerate the little-knowing but talkative and quarrel-some persons in order to bring to light the importance of real knowledge. Those who are compassionate to creatures and are sincerely devoted to real knowledge pay attention to checking the ignoble debates</p>

<p>Those who are not authority in their own treatise often condemn others taking resort to ignoble views, lack of time, illness, arrogance and harshness.

<h1>Discussion with specialists, and winning arguments:</h1>

<p>Discussion with specialists is of 2 types– friendly discussion and hostile discussion.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="vi816">Vi8#16<a href="#vi816" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Vi8#16" title="Direct link to Vi8#16" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>The friendly discussion is held with one who is endowed with learning, understanding and the power of expression and contradiction, devoid of irritability, having uncensored knowledge, without jealousy, able to be convinced and convince others, enduring and adept in the art of sweet conversation.</p>
<p>While discussion with such a person one should speak confidently, put questions unhesitatingly, reply to the sincere questioner with elaborateness, not be agitated whit fear of defect, not be exhilarated on defeating the partner, nor boast before others, not hold fastly his solitary view due to attachment, not explain what is unknown to him, convince the other party with politeness and be cautious in that.</p>
<p>This is the method of friendly discussion.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="vi817">Vi8#17<a href="#vi817" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Vi8#17" title="Direct link to Vi8#17" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Further one should take part in hostile discussion with others looking to his superiority.</p>
<p>Before speaking, he should examine properly the other&#x27;s speech, difference between himself and the opponent and the nature of the congregation.</p>
<p>Proper examination guides the wise about the initiation of and desisting from work, hence the experts commend the examination.</p>
<p>While examining the difference between himself and the opponent one should also examine the merits and demerits of the speaker properly–</p>
<p>such as scriptural knowledge, understanding, retention, imagination and eloquence these are the merits.</p>
<p>These are the demerits such as irritability, lack of skill, cowardice, lack of retention and carelessness.</p>
<p>One should compare himself and the opponent in superiority in respect of these qualities.</p>
<p>Vi8#18</p>
<p>The opponent may be of 3 types- superior, inferior or equal, according to the above qualities and not wholly.</p>
<p>Vi8#19</p>
<p>There are 44 terms relating to terms of discussion given in this chapter.</p>
<p>Vi8#152-154</p>
<p>The 2 types Symposiums:</p>
<p>learned or ignorant.</p>
<p>The 3 types of Symposiums:</p>
<p>friendly, neutral and prejudiced.</p>
<p>In the prejudiced congregation consisting of persons endowed with learning, understanding, speaking and &#x27;contradication&#x27; or of ignorant ones, one should never discuss with anybody.</p>
<p>In the ignorant congregation, however, if it is friendly or neutral, one should discuss with another who is devoid of learning, understanding, speaking and contradication, is not famous and is despised by great men.</p>
<p>While discussing with such a person one should use long sentences having incomprehensible and long aphorisms, should ridicule the opponent again and again with movements of hands before the gathering and should not give opportunity to him to speak, while using difficult words one should remind the opponent that he is not speaking or his proposition does not stand.</p>
<p>Again calling him one should say– &#x27;You should learn for one year more, perhaps you have not learnt from a preceptor or it is sufficient for you.&quot;</p>
<p>The opponent, even defeated once, is taken as defeated and should not be entertained again.</p>
<p>Some say that the same method is applicable in case of hostile discussion with a superior opponent but, in fact, confrontation with a superior person is not at all desirable.</p>
<p>Vi8#20</p>
<p>One should discuss with an inferior or equal opponent in a friendly congregation.</p>
<p>In a neutral congregation having attention, hearing, learning, understanding, power of speaking and contradiction one should carefully weigh the strength and weakness of the opponent.</p>
<p>If the opponent is stronger then he should not continue discussion giving it up without any apparent sign but where the opponent is weak he should be subdued immediately.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-means-of-subduing-the-inferior-opponent-immediately"><strong>The Means of Subduing the Inferior Opponent Immediately:</strong><a href="#the-means-of-subduing-the-inferior-opponent-immediately" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-means-of-subduing-the-inferior-opponent-immediately" title="Direct link to the-means-of-subduing-the-inferior-opponent-immediately" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<table><thead><tr><th>The Opponent&#x27;s Weakness:</th><th>Method of Subduing Him:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>one having no scriptural knowledge</td><td>should be defeated by quoting long aphorisms</td></tr><tr><td>one devoid of understanding</td><td>by sentences with incomprehensible and long</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>aphorisms</td></tr><tr><td>one devoid of imagination</td><td>with similar sentences having various</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>meanings</td></tr><tr><td>one devoid of power of speaking</td><td>by contradicting the half-said sentence</td></tr><tr><td>one devoid of skill</td><td>by putting him in embarrassing situation</td></tr><tr><td>one with irritability</td><td>by teasing him</td></tr><tr><td>one with cowardice</td><td>by terrorizing him</td></tr><tr><td>one devoid of carefulness</td><td>by imposing discipline</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>Thus by these means one should subdue the inferior opponent immediately. Vi8#21</p>
<p>One should speak reasonably while in hostile discussion and should not withdraw the words once spoken.</p>
<p>(It should be born in mind that ) a hostile speech gives rise to strong agitation in some persons.</p>
<p>As for the angry there is nothing either &#x27;unactable&#x27; or un-utterable, the wise do not commend quarreling in the congregation of noble persons.</p>
<p>Thus one should do in discussion initiated.</p>
<p>Vi8#22-24</p>
<p>In the beginning itself one should do like this.</p>
<p>In connivance with the congregation one should get the topic selected as is favorable to him or is very difficult for the opponent or the opponent should be given some quite adverse side.</p>
<p>In the event of support from the congregation, he should speak– &#x27;I have nothing to say more, now this congregation itself will make the decision about the discussion and it&#x27;s result according to it&#x27;s choice, circumstances and views of the members&#x27;-- having said this he should keep quiet.</p>
<p>Vi8#25</p>
<p>The result of the discussion is recorded like this– this is worth speaking, this is not worth-speaking, because of this one is defeated.</p>
<p>Vi8#26</p>
<p>These terms are worth-knowing for acquaintance of the course of discussion among physicians such as–</p>
<p>&#x27;vada&#x27;, dravya, guna, karma, samanya, visesa, samavaya, pratijna, sthapana, partisthapana, hetu, drstanta, upanaya, nigamana, uttara, siddhanta, sabda, pratyaksa, anumana, aitihya, aupamya, saumsaya, prayojana, savyabhicara, jijnsa, vyavasaya, arthaprapti, sambhava, anuyojya, ananuyojya, anuyoga, pratyanuyoga, vakyadosa, vakyaprasamsa, chala, ahetu, atitakala, upalambha, parihara, partijnahani, abhyanujna, hetvantara, arthantara, nigrahasthana</p>
<p>Vi8#27</p>
<p>Vada (debate) is that in which one holds academic discussion with a contending opponent.</p>
<p>This is briefly of 2 types– jalpa (positive discourse) and vitanda (negative</p>
<p>discourse).</p>
<p>Jalpa is the statement of speaker&#x27;s own view as well as (contradiction of) the opponent&#x27;s view.</p>
<p>Vitanda is opposite to jalpa.</p>
<p>For instance, one holds the view that rebirth is there while the other holds the view just against it.</p>
<p>During debate, they advance arguments in support of their own views and expose (and contradict) the opponents&#x27; view, this is jalpa.</p>
<p>Vitanda is opposite to jalpa in which the speaker without having any positive approach only finds faults in the opponents view point.</p>
<p>Vi8#28</p>
<p>Dravya (substance), guna (properties), karma (action), samanya (similarity) visesa (dissimilarity) and samavaya (inherence)-- these are mentioned earlier alongwith their definitions in sutrasthana.</p>
<p>Vi8#29</p>
<p>Pratijna– Partijna (proposition) is the statement of what is to be proved.</p>
<p>For instance, purusa (self) is eternal.</p>
<p>Vi8#30</p>
<p>Sthapana (establishment)- this is establishing the same proposition of firm footing with the help of hetu (reason), drstanta (instance), upanaya (correlation) and nigamana (conclusion).</p>
<p>First there is proposition and then establishment because what can be established in absence of proposition?</p>
<p>For instance, &#x27;self is eternal&#x27; - this is a proposition, reason is - &#x27;because of not being created&#x27;; instance is- &#x27;as sky&#x27;; correlation is- &#x27;as the sky is uncreated and is eternal so is &#x27;self&#x27;; conclusion is- &#x27;therefore, self is eternal&#x27;.</p>
<p>... Vi8#31</p>
<p>Partisthapana (counter-establishment)- this is giving a contrary meaning to the opponent&#x27;s proposition.</p>
<p>For instance, &#x27;self is non-eternal&#x27; is proposition; reason is - &#x27;because of being perceived by senses&#x27;; instance is &#x27;As pitcher&#x27;; correlation is- &#x27;as pitcher is perceived by senses and is non-eternal so is &#x27;self&#x27;; conclusion is- &#x27;therefore, self is non-eternal&#x27;.</p>
<p>Vi8#32</p>
<p>Hetu (reason)- this is the cause of knowledge such as pratyaksa (perception), anumana (inference), aitihya (tradition) and aupamya (analogy).</p>
<p>What is revealed by these reasons (sources) is reality.</p>
<p>Vi8#33</p>
<p>Drstanta (instance)-- this is that which arouses understanding in the fools and the learned alike.</p>
<p>It presents a picturesque image of the thing.</p>
<p>For instance, fire is hot, water is liquid, earth is stable and the sun in illuminating, as the sun is illuminating, the knowledge of the sankhya (philosophy) is also illuminating.</p>
<p>Vi8#34</p>
<p>Upanaya (correlation) and Nigamana (conclusion) are said under the explanation of the headings of &#x27;sthapana&#x27; and &#x27;pratisthapana&#x27;.</p>
<p>Vi8#35</p>
<p>Uttara (rejoinder)-- this is the statement of dissimilarity in the reason of similarity and vice-versa.</p>
<p>For instance, if somebody says- &#x27;disorders are similar to cause as &quot;sitaka&quot; (cold) disease has similar causes like exposure to cold wave&#x27;&quot; the opponent might say- &#x27;disorders are disimilar to cause as in burning sensation, heat, sloughing and suppuration of body parts the causes are dissimilar like cold wave.[&#x27;]</p>
<p>This is rejoinder with contrary statements.</p>
<p>Vi8#36</p>
<p>Siddhanta ((theory)- this is the conclusion which is established by scientists after testing in several ways and on proving it with reasoning.</p>
<p>This is of four types- sarvatantra siddhanta, pratitantra siddhanta, adhikarana siddhanta and adhyupagama siddhanta.</p>
<p>Sarvatantra-siddhanta (universal theory)-- it is that which is accepted universally by all the schools such as- there are causes, there are diseases and there are remedies for the curable disorders.</p>
<p>Pratitantra Siddhanta (restricted theory)-- this is that which is not universal in nature and is held by only one of the schools such as- in other schools there are 8 rasas but here are 6; here are 5 sense organs, while in other texts there are 6 sense organs, in other texts all diseasesa are taken as caused by V etc. but her they are taken as caused by V etc. as well as by the bhutas.</p>
<p>Adhikarana Siddhanta (implied theory)-- this is that which is proved as implication of some other statement such as- fruits of action, emancipation, self and other world are proved in implied way from the statement &quot;the emancipated does not take up the consequent action because of the absence of desires&quot;.</p>
<p>Abhyupagama Siddhanta (hypothetical theory) is that which is held up by physicians temporarily and hypothetically during debate though the idea is unproved, untested, uninstructed and irrational- such as- &#x27; I will speak proposing that dravya is predominant or properties are predominant or virya is predominant.&#x27;</p>
<p>Thus the 4-fold theory.</p>
<p>... Vi8#37</p>
<p>Sabda (word)- this is an aggregate of letters.</p>
<p>This is of 4 types: drstartha, adrstartha, satya and anrta.</p>
<p>Drstartha (with observable meaning)- is that which connotes observable meanings ; such as dosas are aggravated by these etiological factors, they are pacified by 6 therapeutic measures, the sense objects (sound etc.) are perceived if the sense organs (auditory etc.) are existent.</p>
<p>Adrstartha (with unobserving meaning)- this is that which connotes unobservable ideas such as there exists the other world, there is emancipation and so on.</p>
<p>Satya (consistent)-- this is that which is consistent to the facts, such as there are instructions of Ayurveda, remedial measures for the curable diseases and result of action.</p>
<p>Anrta (inconsistent)-- this is contrary to satya. -#38</p>
<p>Pratyaksa (perception)-- this is knowledge which is directly recieved by the self and the sense organs.</p>
<p>Self-perceived are pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, etc., while sound etc. are perceived by the sense organs. - Vi8#39</p>
<p>Anumana (inference) is the reasoning supported by invariable concomitance such</p>
<p>as the knowledge of agni by the power of digestion, that of strength by the power of exercise, auditory organ etc. by the perception of sound etc.</p>
<p>Vi8#40</p>
<p>Aitihya (tradition)-- this is the traditional authoritative source of knowledge such as veda, etc.</p>
<p>Vi8#41</p>
<p>Aupamya (analogy)-- this is the statement of similarity between things such asanalogy of dandaka with danda (staff), that of dhanuhsthmbha with bow and that of the provider of health with the archer.</p>
<p>Vi8#42</p>
<p>Samsaya (doubt)-- this is the state of indecision about the concerned entity. For instance, on observing that both types of persons having or not the signs of longevity and adopting or not the therapeutic measures- die early and live long, doubt arises as whether there is untimely death or not.</p>
<p>Vi8#43</p>
<p>Prayojana (object)-- this is that for which the actions are initiated.</p>
<p>Such as- &#x27;if there is untimely death, I will use life-promoting measures and avoid the contrary ones. Then how would the untimely death subdue me?&#x27;</p>
<p>Vi8# 44</p>
<p>Savyabhicara (uncertain statement)-- this is that which has uncertainty.</p>
<p>Such as &#x27;this medicament may or may not be applicable to this disease&#x27;.</p>
<p>Vi8#45</p>
<p>Jijnasa (inquiry)-- is the (curiosity about) examination.</p>
<p>Such as- (on one&#x27;s inquiry somebody says) the examination of drugs will be described later on.</p>
<p>Vi8#46</p>
<p>Vyavasaya is Niscaya (decision)-- such as- this disease is certainly V, this very is the medicament for this.</p>
<p>Vi8#47</p>
<p>Arthaprapti (acquisition of implied sense)-- this is that where another unsaid idea is conveyed by the said one, such as when one says that the disease is not to be managed with saturating therapy it implies that it is to be managed with desaturating therapy; &#x27;He should not eat during the day&#x27; implies that he should eat during the night.</p>
<p>Vi8#48</p>
<p>Sambhava (source of origin)-- this is that from where something is originated, such as 6 dhatus of foetus, (use of) unwholesome things of disease and (that of) wholesome things of health.</p>
<p>Vi8#49</p>
<p>Anuyojya (questionable statement)-- this is tahtn where sentence is defective or has unspecified meaning inviting further questions, such as if somebody says &#x27;the disease is to be managed with evacuative therapy&#x27; it invites further question as to &#x27;whether it is to be managed with emesis or purgation.</p>
<p>Vi8#50</p>
<p>Ananuyojya (unquestionable statement)- this is contrary to the above.</p>
<p>Such as- &#x27;this (disease) is incurable.&#x27;</p>
<p>Vi8#51</p>
<p>Anuyga (question)-- this is that which is put as query &#x27;wholly or partly, on the text or it&#x27;s part during discussion of experts for the test of learning, understanding,</p>
<p>speaking and contradiction; Such as- on the statement of &#x27;self is eternal&#x27; somebody says &#x27;what is the reason&#x27; .</p>
<p>Vi8#52</p>
<p>Pratyanuyoga (counter-question)-- this is questioning the questions, such as on the above one may ask what is the reason of this question.</p>
<p>Vi8#53</p>
<p>Vakyadosa (syntactical defect)-- in this context, is of 5 types–</p>
<p>Nyuna (deficiency)</p>
<p>Adhika (superfluity)</p>
<p>Anarthaka (meaninglessness)</p>
<p>Aparthaka (deprivation of meaning)</p>
<p>Viruddha (incongruity)</p>
<p>Without these there is no damage to the contextual sense.</p>
<p>Deficiency is such as- if there is lack of even one of the five-proposition, reason, instance, correlation and conclusion- or if there by many reasons, only one reason is resorted to for proving something.</p>
<p>Superfluity is just contrary to deficiency such as- while talking about ayurveda one says about some irrelevant it is repeated, due to repetition this comes under superfluity.</p>
<p>Repetition is of 2 types- semantic repetition and verbal repetition.</p>
<p>The former consists of the repetition of the same idea by different words such as bhesaja, ausadha and sadhana (for therapy) and the latter consists of the repetition of the same word such as &#x27;bhesaja, bhesaja&#x27;.</p>
<p>Meaninglessness is that where there is only jumble of alphabets devoid of any sense.</p>
<p>Deprivation of meaning is due to lack of mutual connection of otherwise meaningful words such as- cakra-na(ta_kra-vamsa-vajra-nisakara.</p>
<p>Incongruity is considered in relation to illustration, theory and convention.</p>
<p>Instance and theory have already been described earlier.</p>
<p>Now convention is of 3 types- Ayurvedic, ritual and ethical.</p>
<p>Ayurvedic convention such as four-legged therapy, ritual convention such as animals are to be sacrificed by sacrificing persons, ethical convention such as nonviolence towards all creatures.</p>
<p>The statement incongruous in respect of the respective convention is taken as incongruity.</p>
<p>Thus are the syntactical defects.</p>
<p>Vi8#54</p>
<p>Vakyaprasamsa (syntactical commendability)- this is that where the statement is</p>
<p>free from deficiency, superfluity, is meaningful, devoid of deprivation of meaning and incongruity, and comprehensible.</p>
<p>Further there is no room for any question.</p>
<p>Such statement is commended.</p>
<p>Vi8#55</p>
<p>Chala (knavery or deceitful disputation)- this is only a jugglery of words in which the words are used knavishly, with apparent meaning or without meaning.</p>
<p>This is of 2 types- Vakchala (verbal knavery) and Samanya Chala (knavery in general).</p>
<p>Verbal Knavery- such as, if somebody says- &#x27;this physician is &quot;navatantra&quot;&#x27;, then the physician retorts- &#x27;I have no &quot;nava&quot; (nine) texts but have only one.&#x27;</p>
<p>Then the other says- &#x27;I am not saying that you have got nine texts but your practice in the same is &quot;nava&quot; (new).&#x27;</p>
<p>On this the physician says &quot;I have not practiced the text newly but many times.&#x27; This is verbal knavery.</p>
<p>Knavery in general- such as, when somebody says- &#x27;medicament is for alleviating the disease.&#x27;, the other person says- &#x27;How do you say the existent is for alleviating the existent because disease is existent and also the medicament, if the existent is capable of alleviating the existent, then both cough and wasting being existent, cough may be able to alleviate the wasting.&#x27;</p>
<p>This is knavery in general.</p>
<p>Vi8#56</p>
<p>Ahetu (fallacious reason)- this is of 3 types- Prakaranasama (similar to topic), Samsayasama (similar to doubt), and Varnyasama (similar to object).</p>
<p>The reason similar to topic such as- the self other than the body is eternal. On this somebody says that because the self is other than the body, it is eternal, as the body is non-eternal, the dissimilar self must be external.</p>
<p>This is fallacious reason because here the paksa (minor term) itself has been used as a reason.</p>
<p>The reason similar to doubt is that which though being cause of doubt is used as cause of eliminating the same such as- &#x27;he has said only a part of Ayurveda, it creates doubt as to whether he is a physician or not&#x27;, on this somebody says- &#x27;as he has said a part of Ayurveda, he is a physician&#x27;.</p>
<p>This does not make a reason for the eliminating of the doubt, thus it is a fallacious reason because that which is the cause of doubt can&#x27;t be the cause of removing the same.</p>
<p>The reason similar to object is that which is not different from the object such as somebody says- &#x27;Buddhi (intellect) is non-eternal because of the absence of touch like sabda (sound). Here both buddhi and sabda are objects, hence because of the absence of difference between them, the reason is similar to object and as such is fallacious.</p>
<p>Vi8#57</p>
<p>Atitakala (delayed statement)-- this is that which actually was to be said earlier but is said later, and because of delayed presentation becomes unacceptable.</p>
<p>For instance, if somebody does not defeat the opponent at the opportune moment but applies it on some other point later on, then, because of delayed application that becomes quite ineffective.</p>
<p>Vi8#58</p>
<p>Upalambha– this is pointing out defects in causality as explained earlier under the heading &#x27;hetu&#x27; fallacious or apparent reason.</p>
<p>Vi8#59</p>
<p>Parihara (refutation)-- this is refuting the above pointing out of defects.</p>
<p>Such as signs of life are available constantly till the self is in the body, and are not available after it goes out.</p>
<p>Therefore, the self is different from the body and is eternal.</p>
<p>Vi8#60</p>
<p>Pratijnahani (loss of proposition)-- this is that when one gives up the original proposition after having been questioned (by the opponent).</p>
<p>For instance, somebody puts proposition as &#x27;the personal self is eternal&#x27; in the beginning but when questioned says that it is non-eternal.</p>
<p>Vi8#61</p>
<p>Abhyanujna (admission of argument)-- this is acceptance of the desired as well as the undesired situations.</p>
<p>Vi8#62</p>
<p>Hetwantara (imperfect reason)-- is that where some imperfect reason is stated instead of some perfect reason.</p>
<p>Vi8#63</p>
<p>Arthantara (irrelevant statement)-- this is that where some other thing is said instead of the relevant one.</p>
<p>For instance, one has to say the symptoms of fever but instead he says those of prameha.</p>
<p>Vi8#64</p>
<p>Nigrahasthana (reason of defect)-- is that by which one is defeated.</p>
<p>It consists of not understanding a thing even in repeated thrice in a learned assembly or questioning where it is not pertinent and not questioning where it is pertinent.</p>
<p>Over and above, pratijnahani, abhyanujna, kaslatitavacana, ahetu, nyuna, adhika, vyartha, anarthaka, punarukta, viruddha, hetwantara and arthantara are reasons of defeat.</p>
<p>Vi8#65</p>
<p>Thus the terms used in course of debate are explained as proposed.</p>
<p>Vi8#66</p>
<p>The debate among physicians should be held only on (topics of) Ayurveda and not elsewhere.</p>
<p>Here the statements and counter-statements in details and also all the arguments have been mentioned in the entire text.</p>
<p>After keeping them in mind one should speak something and not anything which is irrelevant, unscriptural, unexamined, inappropriate, confused or unpervasive.</p>
<p>He should speak everything with reasoning.</p>
<p>All the conflicts of debate, if endowed with reasoning are devoid of malice and promote the (cause of) medicine due to it&#x27;s property of enhancing the excellence of intellect, because undamaged intellect leads to success of actions.</p>
<p>Vi8#67</p>
<p>Now I shall explain some topics for the knowledge of physicians because the wise commend initiation of all actions with prior knowledge.</p>
<p>If after knowing well kaarana, karana, karyayoni, karya, karyaphala, anubandha, desa, kala, pravrtti and upaya one proceeds for some action, he obtains the desired fruit and subsequent benefit in that without any great effort.</p>
<p>Vi8#68</p>
<p>Karana [(Kaarana- long A-)] (doer)-- is that who does a thing, he is the cause of and the agent.</p>
<p>Vi8#69</p>
<p>Karana (instrument) is that which serves as equipment for the doer making effort for performing action.</p>
<p>Vi8#70</p>
<p>Karayoni (original source) is that which is converted into action after transformation.</p>
<p>Vi8#71</p>
<p>Karya (act) is that with the object of performing which the doer proceeds.</p>
<p>Vi8#72</p>
<p>Karyaphala (result of act)- is that with the object of which the action is performed.</p>
<p>Vi8#73</p>
<p>Anubandha (after-effect)- is that which essentially enjoins the doer as after-effect, good or bad, of the action.</p>
<p>Vi8#74</p>
<p>Desa (place) is location.</p>
<p>Vi8#75</p>
<p>Kala (time) is transformation.</p>
<p>Vi8#76</p>
<p>Pravrtti (inclination)- is the effort for the action.</p>
<p>This is also known as kriya, karma, yatna, karyasamarambha.</p>
<p>Vi8#77</p>
<p>Upaya (procedure) is excellence of the first 3 factors, karana, etc. and their proper management leaving aside the karya, karyaphala, and anubandha.</p>
<p>Procedure leads to performance of an action and thus it is said as upaya.</p>
<p>After the action is performed there is no function of procedure nor is it at the time of performance; after action is the result and thereafter consequence (so after action also procedure has no role).</p>
<p>Vi8#78</p>
<p>These 10 entities should be examined first and thereafter one should proceed for action.</p>
<p>Hence the physician desirous of taking up action should before-hand examine the entire situation by proper methods and then initiate the action.</p>
<p>Vi8#79</p>
<p>There, if some other physician or person asks this physician- &#x27;How many types of examination should be adopted by the physician desirous of applying emesis, purgation, non-unctuous and unctuous enema and head-evacuation? How many types of entities are to be examined? How are they to be examined? What is the object of examination? Where are emesis etc. to be applied or contra-indicated? What is to be done in combination of the situations for both application and contra-indication? What drugs are useful for emesis etc.?</p>
<p>Vi8#80</p>
<p>If he wants to confuse the questioner he should say- &#x27;there are many types of examination and groups of the types of entities to be examined. Kindly tell me from what point of view grouped examination or entities to be examined you mean because I</p>
<p>can&#x27;t satisfy you if I explain them taking as grouped from another point of view when, in case, you want to be explained them as grouped from another point of view.</p>
<p>Vi8#81</p>
<p>After considering the reply given by him, one should further say according to the method of contradiction.</p>
<p>IN case, he speaks, properly one should not try to confuse him, rather he should examine him fully and sincerely.</p>
<p>Vi8#82</p>
<p>There are 2 types of examination for those who have already acquired the (scriptural) knowledge- perceptive and inference.</p>
<p>These 2 alongwith the authoritative instruction constitute the (means of) examination.</p>
<p>This examination is of 2 types or of 3 types including authoritative instruction. Vi8#83</p>

<p>Leave confrontation of views aside, because unless the mass of Tamas covering the object is removed, the knowledge will not come forth. -Su25#28</p>
<p>All [theorized/ proposed] entities fit into one of 2 groups– they are either existent or they are non-existent [false].</p>
<p>The means of their examination is 4-fold–</p>
<p>authoritative statement, perception, inference and rationale.</p>
<p>[These 4 examination methods are used to evaluate all postulations.] Su11#17</p>

<p>Authority, perception and inference Vi4#3</p>
<p>Definition of Authority: is the statement from the &quot;Apta&quot; (credible persons).</p>
<p>Aptas are those who possess knowledge which is devoid of any doubt, indirect acquisition, partial acquisition, attachment or aversion.</p>
<p>The statement of such people is testimony. On the contrary, the faulty or otherwise statement of a drunkard, insane person, fool or attached person should not be considered testimony. Vi4#4</p>
<p>(See also &quot;The Teacher&quot; in section on Study.)</p>
<p>Definition of Perception: &quot;Perception is that which is acquired by the sense organs and mind directly&quot; -Vi4#4</p>
<p>It is the knowledge which arises by the contact of self, sense organs, mind and sense objects. It is explicit and limited only to the present.</p>
<p>Su11#20</p>
<p>Definition of Inference: &quot; Inference is reasoning supported by invariable concomitance.&quot; -Vi4#4</p>
<p>It is based on prior perception. It is of 3 types and is related to the 3 times [past, present, future]. For example, one can infer covered fire from the smoke, sexual intercourse from observing the fetus and the future fruit from the seed. By observing the bearing of similar fruit, the learned infer the causation of the seed. Su11#21-22</p>

<p>Out of these 3 sources of knowledge, first of all knowledge is obtained from [1)] authority. Thereafter examination proceeds with [2)] perception and [3)] inference because of there be no authoritative material beforehand what one would know from perception and inference. Thus, for those who have knowledge (of authority) the examination is two-fold: perception and inference. But for others [with no knowledge of authority] it is 3-fold including authoritative instruction.</p>

<p>One, the knower of reality, who does not enter into the inner self of the patient with the help of the lamp of knowledge and intelligence, can&#x27;t treat diseases successfully. Vi4#12</p>

<p>This is the understanding that all things are produced by the combination of multiple causative factors.</p>

<p>The growth of crops is product of the combination of water, ploughing, seed and climate.</p>
<p>The growth of a fetus is the product of the combination of the 6 dhatus.</p>
<p>Fire may be produced by combining the fire-board, spinning stick and the process of spinning.</p>
<p>Similarly, therapeutics is produced by bringing together it&#x27;s 4 legs (doctor, assistant, patient and drug).</p>
<p>Su11#23-24</p>
<p>[A physician must use this sometimes to deduce an outcome, and sometimes to deduce the causative factors behind his patients disease.]</p>
<p>After comprehending the features of diseases in terms of etiology, prodroma, symptoms, suitability, number, predominance, types, proportional variation, severity and time, the physician should know carefully the features of dosas, drugs, place, time, strength, body, sara (constitutional dominance of one or the other dhatu [/dhatu strength]), diet, suitability, psyche, constitution and age because the therapeutic treatment depends on the knowledge of the features of dosas etc. The physician having no knowledge of the features of dosas etc. is incapable of controlling the disease. Hence for the knowledge of the features of dosas etc. I am describing the section on Vimana (specific features) O Agnivesa!</p>
<p>Vi1#3</p>
<p>There are 2 types of persons having appearance of the diseased.</p>
<p>One is that who though suffering from a severe disease appears to be suffering from a mild disease because of excellent psyche, strength and body.</p>
<p>The othe is that who though suffering from a mild disorder appears to be suffering from a severe disorder because of the inferiority of psyche etc.</p>
<p>The physicians who are not acquainted with them fail to decide mildness or severity of the disease proceeding only on gross observation of the patient.</p>
<p>Vi7#3</p>
<p>A part of the means of knowledge is not able to provide understanding of the entire object. Those who fail to diagnose a case also fail to prescribe a rational remedy</p>
<p>for the same. (For instance) when they take the severely diseased as mildly diseased and considering a little morbidity administer mild evacuative drug which further aggravates the dosas. (Likewise) when they take the mildly diseased as the severely diseased and considering great morbidity administer strong evacuative drug which harms the body by over-eliminating the dosas.</p>
<p>Vi7#4</p>
<p>The inexperienced physicians confuse in deciding the severity or otherwise of the disease by seeing only the appearance of the patient having variations due to psyche etc. These ignorant ones, by administering remedies improperly, cause end of the patient or some severe trouble. The learned ones, (on the other hand), after obtaining knowledge about the case by all means never commit mistakes in administration of remedial measure.</p>

<p>Definition of &quot;Roga&quot;: disease</p>
<p>Synonyms of Roga (disease): vyadhi, amaya, gada, atanka, yaksma, jwara, vikara Ni1#5</p>
<p>Synonyms for Disease and Dosha:</p>
<p>The word &quot;Roga&quot; denotes dosa as well as disorder.</p>
<p>&quot;Dosa&quot; has synonyms such as: roga, atanka, yaksman, dosaprakrsti, and</p>
<p>viskara.</p>
<p>&quot;Vyadhi&quot; also has the same synonyms.</p>
<p>&#x27;Thus the word &quot;roga&quot; is similar in case of dosha as well as &quot;vyadhi&quot;, while in other case it is dissimilar.&#x27;</p>

<p>The 10-fold (entities) to be examined, karana etc. mentioned above [in preceding sutras of that chapter], are now shown here with their application to physician etc. Here, in performance of the act</p>
<p>the doer is the physician,</p>
<p>the instrument- is the drugs,</p>
<p>the original source- is the imbalance of dhatus,</p>
<p>the act- is the balance of dhatus,</p>
<p>the result of the act- is attainment of health (and happiness),</p>
<p>the after-effect- is longevity,</p>
<p>the place- is land as well as patient,</p>
<p>the time- is time of year [season], as well as age, and the time-stage of the disese, inclination- is initiation of therapy,</p>
<p>procedure- is excellence of physician etc. [the 4 legs of therapy] and their proper management.</p>
<p>The details about the procedure have already been explained earlier. Thus the 10 entities karana etc. have been shown here as applied to the 10, physician etc., and accordingly the 10-fold entities to be examined are said.</p>
<p>-all the above Vi8#84</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="1-the-doer">1) The Doer:<a href="#1-the-doer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1) The Doer:" title="Direct link to 1) The Doer:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>As already said, doer is the physician. His examination (is this)-- Physician is that who wins over the diseases, is expert in applying the ideas of the aphorisms and knows the life (science) properly from all aspects. He should first of all examine himself (introspect), desirous of performing balance of all dhatus and considering the performance of act in qualified patients and with proper qualities of management as to whether he is capable for the performance of the act. These are the qualities of physicians endowed with which he is capable of bringing forth the balance of dhatus such as– clear knowledge of theoretical ideas, practical knowledge, dexterity, purity, skill, possession of equipments, normalcy of all sense organs, acquaintance with human constitution and knowledge of the course of action.</p>
<p>Vi8#86</p>
<h1>2) The Instrument:</h1>
<p>Instrument is the medicament. Medicament is that which serves as equipment for the physician making effort for effecting balance of dhatus particularly different from the entities ending with procedure [as listed above] (original source, inclination, place, time and procedure). From the point of view of agents employed, medicament or therapy is of 2 types– spiritual and rational. In spiritual therapy incantation, roots, gems, auspicious rites, offerings, gifts, oblations, observance of rules, expiation, fasting, blessings, bowing, visit to temples etc. are employed. In rational therapy, evacuative and pacificatory measures as well as fruitful activities are employed. It is again of 2 types according to form– material and non-material. The non-material therapy includes upayas (devices other than drugs). Upaya means formless entity like terrorizing, creating surprise, forgetfulness, agitation, exhilaration, chiding, threatening for murder, binding, inducing sleep, gentle massage etc. It also includes the aforesaid means of treatment. The material therapy consists of drugs which are used for emesis etc. The drug is examined in respect of nature (natural composition), properties, action, habit, time and mode of collection, storage, processing, dosage, indications for use, the constitution of the patient, and the effect on disorder, whether eliminates it or pacifies it, any other drug of this type should have the same characters.</p>
<p>Vi8#87</p>
<h1>3) The Original Source:</h1>
<p>The original source is the imbalance of dhatus which is known by the emergence of the disorder. Examination of this and the material cause of the disorder (dosas) consists of the observation of the characters of their diminution or aggravation and also of those denoting curability, incurability, mildness and severity of the disorder.</p>
<p>Vi8#88</p>
<h1>4) The Act:</h1>
<p>The act is equilibrium of dhatus which is indicated by alleviation of the disorder. Its examination (is done on the following criteria) <strong>[standard for signs that the disorder has been alleviated:]-- alleviation of the disorder, normalcy of voice and complexion, development of body, increase in strength, desire for food, relish at the meal time, proper and timely digestion of the food taken, timely sleep, non-appearance of abnormal dreams, easy awakening, elimination of urine, feces and semen, overall normalcy of mind, intellect and sense organs.</strong></p>
<p>Vi8#89</p>
<h1>5) The Result of the Act:</h1>
<p>Result of the act is attainment of happiness. It is known by satisfaction of mind, intellect, sense-organs and the body.</p>
<p>Vi8#90</p>
<h1>6) The After-effect:</h1>
<p>After-effect is (maintenance of) life which is characterized by union with vital breath.</p>
<p>Vi8#91</p>
<h1>7) The Place:</h1>
<p>Place is land as well as patient. Land is examined for the knowledge about the</p>
<p>patient or the drug. For the knowledge about the patient (these thing are considered) such as– in what type of land the patient is born, grown or diseased in; in that type of land, the people mostly have such diet, behavior, conduct, strength, mind, suitability, pathology, liking, disorders, wholesomeness and unwholesomeness. The examination of land for knowledge about drugs will be described in kalpasthana.</p>
<p>Vi8#92-93</p>
<p>[Note: Entities 8, 9 and 10- time, inclination and procedure- were not elaborated on in the text. It is presumable that patient would be considered part of 7) The Place.]</p>
<p>Patient is the substratum of the act. Examination of the patient is conducted for the knowledge of the span of life or of the degree of strength and morbidity. Now, (we take up) the examination of patient for knowledge of the degree of strength and morbidity. The variations in quantity of drugs according to the degree of morbidity depend on the degree of strength, because if intensely potent drug is administered suddenly by a physician having not examined properly, it may kill the weak patient; the weak patients are not able to bear intensely potent drugs which are predominant in agni and vayu [fire and air] or cauterization, application of alkali and surgical operation. They may cause instantaneous death due to unbearable and over-intense impulse of the drug. Keeping this in mind, the physicians treat the weak patients with drugs which are unharmful, mild, delicate, heavy in progressive order, without complication, and not creating any emergent condition, particularly ladies, because they have unstable, soft, bare and timid heart, are mostly delicate, weak and subordinate to others. On the other hand, the drug having low potency and applied by one who had not examined properly in strong patients having severe disorder becomes ineffective. Hence the patient should be examined in respect of prakrti (constitution), vikrti (morbidity), sara (constitution [strength] of dhatus), samhanana (compactness), pramana (measurement), satmya (suitability), sattwa (psyche), aharasakti (power of intake and digestion of food), vyayamasakti (power of exercise) and age for the knowledge of the degree of strength.</p>
<p>[These factors have been listed and described. See their section, {later in Diagnosis chptr}]</p>
<p>Vi8#94</p>
<p>--------------- The disorders which are not corresponding to the vitiation of dosas, are found to have [been] caused by the wrath of god etc. because of authoritative statement, appearance of miraculous signs and symptoms, specificity of cause, signs and symptoms and treatment.</p>

<p>Different practitioners may classify diseases differently according to differences in point of view. This is one more reason for the great number of possible diseases.</p>
<p>Vi6#14</p>
<p>Diseases are in fact innumerable, being divided on the basis of disorder, color, etiology, symptoms, and name. Their systematization has been attempted in the form of some gross diseases. However, in other cases, general principle may be followed.</p>
<p>-Su18#42-43</p>
<p>If you are not able to label a disorder with it&#x27;s proper name, do not feel ashamed because not all disorders have established footing by name. The reason is that the same</p>
<p>vitiated dosa causes various disorders according to variation in etiology and location. Hence one should initiate treatment after having complete knowledge about the nature of the disorder (pathogenesis), locations and etiological factors. The one who initiates treatments, after knowing these 3, rationally and according to prescribed procedure, does not get confused in actions.</p>

<p>All the innate disorders do not arise except from V, P and K. As a bird, though flying overall the day, does not transcend it&#x27;s shadow, all the disorders caused by disequilibrium of innate factors do not go beyond (causation of) V, P and K. The wise physicians having observed the location, characters and functions of V, P and K define the disorders caused by them.</p>
<p>Su19#5</p>
<p>The multiple groups of disorders in the body which are caused by the disequilibrium of innate factors are not independent of P, K and V. Only exogenous disorders are different from them.</p>

<h1>Understanding the Single (Taste or Dosha) Vs. the Aggregate (Drug or Disease):</h1>
<p>It is important to understand the picture in terms of the effect of rasa (taste) (individual) and dravya (drug) (total) on one side and dosa (individual) and disease (total) on the other.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="vi112">Vi1#12<a href="#vi112" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Vi1#12" title="Direct link to Vi1#12" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<h1>How to Evaluate Drugs with Multiple Tastes or Diseases with Multiple Doshas:</h1>
<p>Where there is a substance having several tastes or a disorder having several doshas one should first critically analyze the role of rasas or dosas individually and then decide the effect of the substance or the disorder wholly.</p>

<p>But this rule is not applicable universally because in case of the disorders where the effect is not exactly in accordance with the cause due to various causative factors operating, mutual subordination and variation in processings, it is not possible to decide the effect of the total drug or disease on the basis of the effect of it&#x27;s individual rasas (tastes) or dosas.</p>

<p>Secondary Disorder:</p>
<p>When dosas having characters of primary disorder combine all the 3 together that is called as sannipata or if combine 2 together that is samsarga.</p>
<p>&quot;Due to variations in primary and secondary characters there are numerous variations in dosas. Thus physicians attribute various nomenclatures to dosas and disorders classified in different groups according to various factors.&quot;</p>
<p>Vi6#11 [Nearly verbatim is O.K. for this edition!]</p>

<p>Disease is also observed as serving the purpose of etiology in respect of (another) disease. For example, hyperpyrexia gives rise to internal hemorrhage which in turn causes fever and both together give rise to phthis. From enlargement of spleen arises udararoga and from udara appears edema. From piles arises terrible udararoga and also gulma. Coryza gives rise to cough which produces wasting which results in causation of phthisis.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="ni816-19">Ni8#16-19<a href="#ni816-19" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ni8#16-19" title="Direct link to Ni8#16-19" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Initially they are only disorders, and later on serve as etiological factors. At times they serve the purpose of both (disease and etiology) and sometimes of only one (either disease or etiology).</p>
<p>Ni8#20</p>
<p>Because some disease, after causing another disorder, subsides while the other does not subside and at the same time also serve as etiology.</p>
<p>Ni8#21</p>
<p>Thus obstinate intermingling of diseases is observed due to [1)] faulty treatment and [2)] origin from one another.</p>
<p>Ni8#22</p>
<p>The therapy which pacifies one disorder but at the same time gives rise to some other disorder is not correct; the correct treatment is that which while pacifying (a disorder) does not excite (another one).</p>
<p>Ni8#23</p>
<p>One cause produces several disorders or sometimes only one. Likewise, one disorder is caused by many factors and sometimes many disorders are caused by those ones. For instance, from rough substances arise fever, giddiness, delirium etc. and sometimes fever only. Likewise, many factors such as rough etc. cause only fever while sometimes they produce many disorders in addition to fever.</p>
<p>Ni8#24-26</p>
<p>One symptom pertains to many diseases as well as one disease. Likewise, many symptoms arise is [in] one disease as well as many diseases. For instance, fever is the (common) symptom of many diseases having irregular onset and complicated origin while hyperpyrexia is the symptom of fever only. Many symptoms related to irregular onset and complicated origin are found in fever while the same are observed also in several diseases like fever, dyspnea, hiccup etc.</p>
<p>Ni8#27-29</p>
<p>One pacificatory measure is useful in many disorders as well as in single disorder. Likewise, many measures are required for a single disorder as well as multiple ones. For instance, the single reducing therapy pacifies many disorders arisen from amasaya and</p>
<p>sometimes single disease ([i.e.,] fever) responds to the therapy (reducing one). Likewise, several measures light diet etc. are prescribed in fever alone while all these are applied in several disorders like fever, dispnea, hiccup etc.</p>
<p>Ni8#30-32</p>
<p>Easily curable disease is cured with easy means and in a short time. Disease curable with difficulty requires great effort and long duration for cure. Palliable diseases which are incurable are not eradicated. The other type of incurable disease, the rejectable one, fails to respond to all measures.</p>
<p>Ni8#33-35</p>
<p>** The learned physician should observe the states of aggravation, normalcy and diminution of diseases even if they are subtle along with the condition of agni, strength and mind.</p>
<p>The wise physician constantly observing the conditions of the disorder and administering the treatment accordingly obtains the beneficial four (virtue, wealth, enjoyment and emancipation).</p>
<p>Ni8#36-37</p>
<p>** Often the obliquely spreading dosas afflict the patients for long [causing chronic, long-standing disease]. In these conditions, one knowing the strength of agni and the strength of dhatus should not administer therapy in haste.</p>
<p>(Instead), he should reduce the dosas gradually with therapeutic measures or bring them &quot;conveniently&quot; [gently/ when they are in the bowels, they are convenient, easy to remove] to the bowels. When they reach the bowels, they should be eliminated according to convenience.</p>
<p>Ni8#38-39 [The above paragraph is an important description of the decision-making process for whether to do P.K. or lightening therapies for a particular case.]</p>
<p>For the sake of knowledge, the symptoms of the diseases which are mentioned in this section are themselves diseases but in the present context they are symptoms not diseases.</p>
<p>Ni8#40</p>
<p>In short, both disease and health are dependent on respective causes and as such can not continue in their absence.</p>
<p>Ni8#41</p>
<p>[The above section from Ni8 is quite important]</p>

<p>According to the particular features of etiology, dosas and DUSYAS (substratum of pathology; [the tissues]) response occurs in the form of non-manifestation or otherwise of the disorders. When these 3 factors (nidana, etc.) do not combine together or if combined after a long time or in weakened state, disorder will not be there, or it will manifest lately, or in a mild form or without all the said symptoms. On the contrary, the</p>
<p>result will be contrary. Thus is said the cause of response on the form of nonmanifestation or otherwise of all disorders.</p>

<p>The physicians (the inexperienced) who are not acquainted with them fail to decide Mildness or Severity of the disease proceeding only on gross observation of the patient.</p>
<p>Those who fail to diagnose a case also fail to prescribe a rational remedy for the same. For example, when they take the severely diseased as mildly diseased and thinking the patient has only little morbidity he administers mild evacuative drug, which further aggravates the doshas. Likewise, when he mistakes a mildly diseased person as a severely diseased person with great morbidity, and so administers strong evacuative drug which <strong>harms the body by over-eliminating the doshas</strong>. The consequence can be severe trouble or death.</p>
<p>[[&quot;Thus, the physicians who know from all aspects never confuse if they take action after examining the entire situation by all means as far as possible and thus achieve the desired objective.&quot; ]]</p>

<p>How to Gage the Strength of the Patient&#x27;s Body, His Doshas and Dose for Medication:</p>

<p>One should determine the strength of the entities like Prakrti etc. (except Vikrti), as described in &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;Dhatu&quot; and &quot;Dosha&quot; sections.</p>
<p>Each one should be classified as either 1)Superior, 2)medium or 3)inferior.</p>

<p>Then one should determine the degree of strength of the doshas.</p>
<p>This is inferred by knowing the severity of vikrti (morbidity) of the doshas [(according to symptoms)].</p>
<p>The doshas also should each be graded as either Superior, Medium or Inferior. Vi8#123</p>

<p>One must know which medicaments are strong, moderate and mild.</p>

<p>Vi8#101</p>
<p>Q: It is observed that the persons taking wholesome food are both diseased and healthy, similarly in case of the unwholesome food. In the face of such observations how the difference in good and bad effects can be attributed to the intake of wholesome and unwholesome food respectively?</p>
<p>A: The persons taking wholesome food do not suffer from the diseases caused by the same because the use of wholesome food alone is not able to avert the fear of all diseases as there are other etiological factors even except the use of unwholesome food such as– :</p>
<p>abnormality in time factor,</p>
<p>intellectual error and</p>
<p>unsuitable sound, touch, vision, taste and smell.</p>
<p>These etiological factors afflict the person in spite of his taking proper food. That is why the persons taking wholesome food are also seen as diseased.</p>
<p>In case of those taking unwholesome food too, the fault does not produce derangements immediately due to certain reasons such as:</p>
<p>unwholesome articles are not equally deranging</p>
<p>nor have the dosas equal strength,</p>
<p>all persons also are not (equally) capable to resist the disease (have no equal immunity).</p>
<p>The same faulty regimen becomes obnoxious due to place, time, combination, potency and excessive quantity.</p>
<p>The same dosa too, in combination with other dosa, having contradictory therapy, deep-seated, with long duration, located in the origins of vital breathy, affecting the vital parts becomes curable with difficulty and even fatal emergently.</p>
<p>The persons too obese, too lean, having uncompact muscles, blood and bones, weak, indulged in unsuitable food, under-nourished and having weak mind are not able to resist diseases.</p>
<p>Contrary to them are able to resist diseases.</p>
<p>Because of variations in faulty diet, innate pathogenic factors and the condition of the body, the diseases become mild or severe, acute or chronic.</p>
<p>The same V, P and K, vitiated in different locations produce different disorders. Su28#6+7</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="prognosis-1">[Prognosis:]<a href="#prognosis-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to [Prognosis:]" title="Direct link to [Prognosis:]" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>There are certain curable diseases of severe nature which become fatal in case they are improperly managed or not given adequate treatment. There are other curable diseases which are mild and get alleviated certainly with or without effort.</p>
<p>There are other incurable diseases known as palliable in which even excellent treatment enables the patient to move along. While there are other (incurable) diseases where even the treatment with much effort provided by the ignorant (physicians) does not succeed. The wise (physician) should not treat them.</p>

<p>The following entities should be examined by the physician desiring to know the remaining span of life with perception, inference and authoritative statements such as:</p>
<p>complexion, voice, smell, taste, touch, visual organ, auditory organ, olfactory organ, gustatory organ, tactile organ, psyche, inclination, cleanliness, conduct, behavior, memory, facial expression, normalcy, morbidity, strength, malaise, intellect, exhilaration, roughness, unctuousness, drowsiness, initiation, severity, mildness, qualities (possessed by substance), diet, activities, digestion of food, management, mis-management, disease, prodroma of diseases, complaints, complications, lustre, shadow, dreams, messenger, bad omens in the way, changed condition of the patient&#x27;s residence, success of the therapy and application of remedy in disorders.</p>
<p>In1#3</p>
<p>Out of these entities to be examined, some do not relate to the person while others do.</p>
<p>Those in the first category should be examined with authoritative statements and rationale while those in the second category by (observing the ) normal constitution and morbidity.</p>
<p>In1#4</p>
<p>Normal constitution is governed by several factors such as birth (genetic factor), family, place, time, age and individuality.</p>
<p>The entities of the person s are determined by these factors.</p>
<p>In1#5</p>
<p>Morbidity is of 3 types: caused by bodily marks, caused by diseases and caused by other factors.</p>
<p>In1#6</p>
<p>The first type of morbidity is that which is caused by the bodily marks due to past deeds.</p>
<p>Certain bodily marks are fixed in some body parts which produces abnormality by getting opportunity in favorable times.</p>
<p>In1#7</p>
<p>She second type of morbidity is produced by obvious diseases which are described in the chapter on diagnosis in respect of their etiology.</p>
<p>In1#7</p>
<p>The third type of morbidity is caused by factors which are not etiological in nature but resemble them in effect.</p>
<p>In fact, it appears without any apparent cause and indicates the measure of the life-span particularly the signs of imminent death due to decadence of life.</p>
<p>The physicians pay due importance to this and describe this for the knowledge of life (and death). In1#7</p>
<p>Based on this (I) will explain the signs observed in the person which indicate his imminent death.</p>
<p>This is the gist, (I) will explain it in detail further.</p>
<p>In1#7</p>
<p>First of all, I will take the topic of Complexion.:</p>
<p>Black, silky-like, skylike-fair and fair– these are the normal shades of complexion of the body.</p>
<p>In1#8</p>
<p>There may be other shades which should be known from the simile or the experts. In1#8</p>
<p>Blue, blackish, coppery, green and white– these types of complexion are pathological in comparison with earlier (normal)ones and appear for the first time.</p>
<p>These normal and abnormal shades of complexion of the body are said.</p>
<p>In1#9</p>
<p>Normal complexion in one half and abnormal one in the other half of the body demarcated clearly as left and right, front and back, upper and lower or internal and external should be known as &#x27;arista&#x27; (fatal sign) of the patient.</p>
<p>Such demarcation of complexions in face and other parts too indicate death (of the person).</p>
<p>In1#10</p>
<p>Similarly, on this line, malaise and cheerfulness, roughness and unctuousness are described.</p>
<p>In1#11</p>
<p>In the same way, appearance of any one of mole, freckles, black mole and pimple on the face of patient should be taken as inauspicious.</p>
<p>In1#12</p>
<p>Appearance of any of the abnormal complexions in nails, eyes, face, urine, feces, hands, feet, lips, etc. particularly in patients with diminished strength, complexion and sense indicates the loss of life.</p>
<p>In1#13</p>
<p>Such other abnormal complexions too which appear suddenly for the first time without any apparent cause in the patient going down constantly are the signs of death.</p>
<p>In1#14</p>
<p>The voices resembling those of swan, demoiselle crane, felly of wheel, kettledrum, house sparrow, crow, pigeon and jharjhara (a sort of drum) are taken as &#x27;normal&#x27;.</p>
<p>Other such voices may be known from simile or the experts.</p>
<p>The abnormal voice is like that of sheep (or goat) and is feeble, subdued, indistinct, choked, faint, poor and stammering and as such other types of voice too which are abnormally different from the earlier ones and appear for the first time.</p>
<p>Thus normal and abnormal voices are described.</p>
<p>In1#15</p>
<p>Sudden appearance of the abnormal types of voice, presence of various voices or of various types of one voice is regarded as inauspicious.</p>
<p>Thus the topic of voice has been described.</p>
<p>In1#16</p>
<p>Thus complexion and voice as knowledge of signs of death has been described. In1#17</p>
<p>The abnormal complexion, if arises in the entire or half of the body without an apparent cause, indicates death.</p>
<p>In1#18</p>
<p>If one half of the face is blue, blackish, coppery or reddish and the other one has different</p>
<p>complexion, it is a fatal sign.</p>
<p>In1#19</p>
<p>Unctuousness in one half of the face and roughness in the other one, malaise in one half and cheerfulness in the other is the sign of the dead.</p>
<p>In1#20</p>
<p>Black moles, moles, freckles and various streaks appear suddenly on the face of a patient who is about to expire.</p>
<p>In1#21</p>
<p>Flower-like signs in the nails or teeth, muddy coating on teeth and powder-like substance on teeth are signs of death.</p>
<p>In1#22</p>
<p>Abnormal color in lips, feet, hands, eyes, urine, feces and nails in weak patient is fatal.</p>
<p>In1#23</p>
<p>The patient who&#x27;s lips are blue (cyanotic) like ripe jamuna fruits should be regarded as one devoid of life-span and about to die.</p>
<p>In1#24</p>
<p>If one or several abnormal voices suddenly appear in a decaying patients, it indicates death.</p>
<p>In1#25</p>
<p>Whatever other abnormalities of voice and complexion are found in a patient devoid of strength and flesh , they indicate the advent of death.</p>
<p>#26</p>
<p>One who is well acquainted with these signs does not get confused in deciding the life-span.</p>
<p>In1#27</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="chapter-ii-the-flowered-person">Chapter II: &quot;The Flowered Person&quot;<a href="#chapter-ii-the-flowered-person" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chapter II: &quot;The Flowered Person&quot;" title="Direct link to Chapter II: &quot;The Flowered Person&quot;" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>[[This chapter is about smells; the reference to a flower is to it&#x27;s</p>
<p>As flower is manifestation preceeding the would-be fruit, the fatal signs known as &#x27;arista&#x27; precede death.</p>
<p>In2#3</p>
<p>fragrance.]]</p>
<p>Sometimes a flower may not be followed by a fruit or a fruit may appear without</p>
<p>a preceding flower, but the arisen fatal signs do not faint away without (leading to) death; On the other hand, there is no death which is not preceded by the fatal signs.</p>
<p>In2#4-5</p>
<p>Taking other resembling signs wrongly as the fatal ones, not knowing as such the signs which are not fatal and not ascer5taining the real fatal signs– all this is due to intellectual error.</p>
<p>In2#6</p>
<p>In order to furnish knowledge in this respect, I will describe various flowered cases having various types of signs preceding death.</p>
<p>In2#7</p>
<p>The person who emits constant fragrance resembling that of various flowers like blossomed forest with many trees and creepers is said as &#x27;flowered&#x27;, with fatal signs and by the end of the year certainly gives up the body (dies).</p>
<p>In2#8-9</p>
<p>In this way, if one emits fragrance, similar to that of individual flowers, desirable or undesirable, he is known as flowered.</p>
<p>In2#10</p>
<p>If, in the patients body, a physician perceives undesirable smell– collectively or individually, the patient should be taken as flowered.</p>
<p>In2#11</p>
<p>Whether bathed or not, if the body becomes a resort of desirable or undesirable smells alternatively and without apparent cause the patient is said as flowered.</p>
<p>For instance- sandal, kustha, tagara, aguru, honey and garland (with desirable smell ) an urine, feces, corpses or carcasses (with undesirable smell).</p>
<p>Other smells of various types and of various sources may be known as abnormal from inference.</p>
<p>I will tell about another sign in respect of smell.</p>
<p>As a general rule, on the basis of which a physician should predict the death of a patient.</p>
<p>The patient who gets smell desirable or undesirable in the body suddenly and without an apparent cause does not survive till the end of the year.</p>
<p>In2#12-15</p>
<p>This is the information about smell.</p>
<p>In2#16</p>
<p>Hereafter the information about taste arisen in the body of patient will be described properly.</p>
<p>The taste of the body in normal persons gets 2 types of changes in the last moments.</p>
<p>Some of the tastes become un-pleasant while others become exceedingly pleasant.</p>
<p>This sort of abnormality may be known by inference because how a man would receive the taste of another man.</p>
<p>Flies lice, stinging insects and mosquitoes get away from the body with unpleasant taste of a person who is about to die.</p>
<p>On the other hand, flies are attracted constantly to the exceedingly sweet body of a patient who is ripened enough for the time of death even after bath and application of cosmetics.</p>
<p>In2#17-22</p>
<p>In general the signs of the flowered person in respect of taste and smell have been described.</p>
<p>One should predict death on their basis.</p>

<p>(&quot;The chapter on palpable entities&quot;)</p>
<p>One desiring ton know the remaining span of life of a patient mainly by touch should palpate his entire body with his normal hand or should get it palpated by somebody else.</p>
<p>While palpating the body he should know about the following entities such as– Loss of pulsation in body parts having constant pulsation presence of coldness in those which are always hot Similarly hardness of the soft body parts, Coarseness of the smooth body parts absence of the existent body parts looseness, dislocation or falling down of joints</p>
<p>loss of flesh and blood hardness excessive perspiration stiffness</p>
<p>any other such palpable sign having excessive morbidity and with no apparent cause.</p>
<p>Thus the features of the palpable entities are said in brief.</p>
<p>In3#3</p>
<p>This being explained in detail–</p>
<p>if on palpation feet, knees, thighs, buttocks, abdomen, sides, back, vertebral column, hands, neck, palate, lips and forehead individually are felt as sweating, cold, stiff, hard or devoid of flesh and blood, it should be known that the patient will die in a short time.</p>
<p>On palpation if his ankles, knees, groins, anus, testicles, penis, navel, shoulder breast, wrist joints, ribs, jaw, nose, ears, eyes, eyebrows, temples etc. are found separately as loosened, deranged, fallen or dislocated, it should be known that the person will soon die.</p>
<p>In3#5</p>
<p>Moreover, his inspiration, carotid regions, feet, eyelashes, eyes, hairs, body hairs, nails and fingers should be examined.</p>
<p>If his inspiration is too deep or too shallow he should be taken as dying.</p>
<p>If his carotid regions are not found pulsating, he should be taken as dying.</p>
<p>If his teeth are scattered about, excessively white and having gravels, he should be considered as dying.</p>
<p>If his eyelashes are matted, he should be known as dying.</p>
<p>If his eyes are devoid of normalcy and having abnormalities such as == too much sunk, too much slanted, exceedingly unequal, excessively loose, too much lachrymated, constantly open, constantly closed, with excessive blinking an opening of eyes;</p>
<p>perturbed, reverted, diminished or deranged vision; blindness of mongoose or pigeon (color blindness), red like fire-brand, having excessively one of these colorsblack, yellow, blue, blackish, coppery, green, deep yellow and white– he should be known as dying. - In3#6</p>
<p>One should pull out his hairs and body hairs, if they come out without pain, he should be taken as dying.</p>
<p>If in his abdomen blackish, coppery, blue, deep yellow or white veins are predominant he should be known as dying.</p>
<p>If his nails are devoid of flesh and blood and have color like that of ripe jamuna fruits (cyanosed), he should be declared as dying.</p>
<p>One should pull out his fingers; if they do not give rise to cracking sound, he should be known as dying.</p>
<p>In3#6</p>
<p>One who knows the various palpable entities by palpating the patient, he does not confuse in knowing his life-span.</p>

<p>Please listen how an expert physician should examine the sense organs in order to know the span of life.</p>
<p>As the sense organs transcend all the senses, they may be examined, in reality, by inference.</p>
<p>In4#3-4</p>
<p>The perception pertaining to the sense organs which is abnormal and arisen without an apparent cause is indicative of death.</p>
<p>This is in general about the inauspicious signs relating to the sense organs and is described again in detail hereafter.</p>
<p>In4#5-6</p>
<p>The patient who sees the sky as solidified (like earth) or the earth like the sky (void), both in contradiction, attains death.</p>
<p>In4#7</p>
<p>One who sees the air moving in the sky but does not visualize the kindled fire should be taken with lost life.</p>
<p>In4#8</p>
<p>If in a clean water, stable or flowing, and without having a net one sees net, he is deprived of life.</p>
<p>In4#9</p>
<p>While awake if one visualizes ghosts and various demons or some other surprising thing, he is unable to live.</p>

<p>In4#14</p>
<p>If one sees the sun in night, or the moon in day or smoke arisen in absence of fire or lusterless fire in night, he is about to die.</p>
<p>In4#15</p>
<p>When one is going to give up his existence, he sees brilliant objects as devoid of brilliance, or non-brilliant objects as brilliant ones or other objects devoid of their normal characters.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">In4#16</li>
</ul>
<p>The persons, at the end of life, see the objects as deformed, of different color, in different number without an apparent cause. - In4#17</p>
<p>If one sees the non-visible objects or does not see the visible one– both types of persons die soon.</p>
<p>In4#18</p>
<p>One who hears sound when there is none or does not perceive the real one– both these types of person should be taken as almost dead. - In4#19</p>
<p>One who does not hear the heat-sound after closing the ears with the fingers, he should be known as devoid of life-span and should be discarded.</p>
<p>In4#20</p>
<p>One who perceives the goodness and badness of smell contrarily or does not perceive the smell entirely, he should be known as devoid of life.</p>

<p>In4#22</p>
<p>If one perceives the touch sensations like hot-cold, coarse-smooth and soft-hard contrarily, he is about to die.</p>
<p>In4#23</p>
<p>Super-sensory perception without austere penance or methodical concentration of mind indicates death.</p>
<p>In4#24</p>
<p>If one perceives the senses rightly inspite of incapability of the sense organs, it indicates death.</p>
<p>In4#25</p>
<p>If the healthy persons due to contrariety of intellect perceive the senses frequently in abnormal for they are not so, they should be considered as almost dead.</p>
<p>In4#26</p>
<p>The physician who is possessed of the correct knowledge about the senses, is able to know the life and death.</p>
<p>In4#27</p>

<p>(I) will now describe the prodroma of the incurable diseases separately in general as well as specific way for the advancement of knowledge of physicians.</p>
<p>If a patient of fever shows all the prodromal signs and symptoms mentioned in the context of fever, he becomes a victim of death.</p>
<p>In other diseases too, if prodroma are found in such a way, it is sure sign of death. In5#3-5</p>
<p>Now I shall mention some of the severe prodroma which associate with the diseases and are followed by death.</p>
<p>If a person due to excessive sexual indulgence, is affected with strength gradually decreasing and coryza gradually increasing, it leads to phthisis and eventually death. Of a patient is carried to the south by dogs, camels or asses in a dream, he is affected by phthisis leading to death.</p>
<p>In dream, if one drinks urine with ghosts or is dragged by dogs, he gets attacked by fever which becomes fatal.</p>
<p>In5#6-9</p>
<p>If one sees the sky from nearby distance as (red) like a cloth dyed with lack, he gets affected by internal hemorrhage which causes his death.</p>

<p>In5#10-11</p>
<p>Excessive colic, meteorism, gurgling sound, debility and discoloration of nails etc indicate the advent of gulma causing death eventually.</p>

<p>In dream, if lotus flowers arise in the chest of a person who is naked, bathed with ghee and pouring oblations to flame-less fire he dies of leprosy.</p>
<p>In5#14-15</p>
<p>If flies are attracted too much to the body of person even after bath and after-paste it indicates the advent of prameha which leads to his death.</p>
<p>One who, in dream, drinks various fats in company of candalas and is bound by them, gets attacked with fatal type of prameha.</p>
<p>In5#17-18</p>
<p>Fixed look, exhaustion, agitation, inopportune confusion, restlessness and debility– these indicate the advent of insanity and consequent death.</p>
<p>In5#18</p>
<p>The expert physician observing a person having dislike for food, loss of mind and urticarial rashes should declare him as a would-be case of fatal type of insanity.</p>
<p>In5#19</p>
<p>One who is irritable, terrorized, rarely having smile on his face, and with excessive fainting and thirst, gets, fatal insanity. - In5#20</p>
<p>One who, in dream, sinks in water while dancing with demons gets insanity which leads him to the other world. In5#21</p>
<p>While awake, if one sees darkness which is not existing and hears various nonexisting sounds, he dies of epilepsy. In5#22</p>

<p>In5#23</p>
<p>One who, while awake, gets his jaws, carotid regions and eyes stiffened, becomes affected with fatal type of Bahirayama (opisthotonus). In5#24</p>
<p>If, in dream, one eats saskuli or apupa (types of dietary preparations) and vomits similar matter, he lives no more after waking up.</p>
<p>In5#25</p>
<p>One who knows these prodroma well can understand their association (with diseases) and the result (death).</p>
<p>In5#26</p>
<p>The following other severe dreams may also be known because they indicate death of or great calamity to the patient (such as)-</p>
<p>if bamboo, shrub, creeper etc. arise on one&#x27;s head wherein birds hide themselves and one who gets his head clean-shaved;</p>
<p>one who is surrounded in dream by vultures, owls, dogs and crows as well as by raksasa, preta, pisca (various types of demons), women, candala, dravidians and Andhras;</p>
<p>One who is stuck up in the bush of bamboo, canes, creepers, grasses and thorny herbs or falls down while going;</p>
<p>if one falls down, in dream, on the ground full of dust, or ant-hill or ashes or cremation ground or ditch;</p>

<p>in dream the vision of person s wearing ochre-colored garments;</p>
<p>ghastly appearance, naked, carrying stick, black-complexioned and red-eyed is not regarded as auspicious.</p>
<p>The dream of a woman- black-complexioned, sinner, characterless, with long hairs, nails and breast, devoid of cosmetics, garland and apparel– is just like the night of death.</p>
<p>These are the severe dreams which indicate the death of a patient while one devoid of illness, in rare cases, escapes even after reaching the doubtful point.</p>
<p>... In5#27-40</p>
<p>A person sees severe dreams in critical period due to filling up of the mindcarrying channels by exceedingly powerful 3 dosas.</p>
<p>A person comes across various fruitful or fruitless dreams in subconscious stage because of the mind leading the sense organs.</p>
<p>In5#41-42</p>
<p>Dream is known as of 7 types such as:</p>
<p>Based on:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<ol>
<li class="">visual experience</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="">
<ol start="2">
<li class="">auditory experience</li>

<li class="">future consequences</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="">
<ol start="7">
<li class="">dosas</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In5#43</p>
<p>Out of them, the first 5 are fruitless and also those experienced in day, and which are too short or too long.</p>
<p>The dream experienced in early hours of night yields small result, if one does not sleep again after experiencing the dream, it is highly and immediately fruitful.</p>
<p>If after experiencing an inauspicious dream one sees again a soothing and auspicious dreams just afterwards- it yields goo result.</p>
<p>In5#44-46</p>
<p>The physician who knows these severe prodromal signs and dreams, does not take up the incurable cases due to ignorance.</p>

<p>In10#3</p>
<p>Severe type of vatasthila (stone-like enlargement with predominance of V) quite aggravated and located in the cardiac region associated with excessive thirst causes sudden death.</p>
<p>In10#4</p>
<p>If V, while moving in the body, slackens the calf regions and makes the nose crooked, it causes sudden death.</p>
<p>In10#5</p>
<p>In a patient having loss of blood and flesh, if V moves upwards and affects both the carotid regions equally, it takes away the life suddenly.</p>

<p>In10#17</p>
<p>Teeth as annointed with mud, face as if powdered, body parts having cold clammy perspiration indicate patient&#x27;s sudden death.</p>
<p>In10#18</p>
<p>A patient afflicted with thirst, dyspnea, headache, fainting, debility, groaning and diarrhea die soon.</p>
<p>In10#19-20</p>

<p>A patient whose offerings is not accepted by crows goes to the other world within a year to eat the offered bolus.</p>
<p>In11#4</p>
<p>One who does not see Arundhati ( a star) situated near the seven sages (the great bear in the sky) faces the great darkness (death) by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In11#5</p>
<p>The patient who gains or loses lustre, corpulence or wealth survives utmost for a year.</p>
<p>In11#6</p>
<p>Inclination, conduct, memory, sacrifice, intellect and strength, these 6 entities go away from the patient who is to die within 6 months.</p>
<p>In11#7</p>
<p>The patient in whose forehead is seen a beautiful network of unforeseen blood vessels does not survive beyond six months.</p>
<p>In11#8</p>
<p>If the forehead of a patient is full of crescent-shaped streaks, it indicates his death within six months.</p>
<p>In11#9</p>
<p>If there are tremors in the body, stupor, movements and speech like an insane, it indicates death with a month.</p>
<p>In11#10</p>
<p>The patient whose semen, urine and stool sink in water and who dislikes his kins drowns in the waters of death within a month.</p>
<p>In11#11</p>
<p>If the extremities and the face are dried up or swollen without the main trunk of the body, it indicates death of the patient within a month.</p>
<p>In11#12</p>
<p>Appearance of a crescent-shaped blue streak in forehead, head or pelvic region indicates death of the patient.</p>
<p>In11#13</p>
<p>The patient in whose body masurika (chicken pox) erupts like coral beads and disappear instantaneously, dies soon.</p>
<p>In11#14</p>

<p>Excessive giddiness, delirium and breaking pain in bones– these three symptoms appear in a patient having noose of death (in his neck).</p>
<p>In11#16</p>

<p>In11#17</p>
<p>The patient who searches for his fingers and hands putting them before his eyes and smiles while having his eyes directed upwards and unblinking should be taken as blinded by death.</p>

<p>In11#19</p>
<p>If a patient, due to mental confusion, laughs irrelevantly, licks his lips and has feet, hands and breathing as cold does not survive.</p>
<p>In11#20</p>
<p>A patient having his mind covered with great tamas (the principle of ignorance) does not perceive even though looking at their kins or attendants who are calling him from nearby.</p>
<p>In11#21</p>
<p><strong>The wise physician finding absence and excess of akasa etc. (mahabhutas) simultaneously in the patient&#x27;s body should not prescribe medicines.</strong></p>
<p>In11#22</p>
<p>When the disease aggravate severely and mental strength deteriorates, strength of speech, sense organs and mind– all these diminish, and &quot;sleep comes ever or never&quot;.</p>
<p>In11#23-24</p>
<p>The patients who develop dislike for physician, medicines, food, preceptor and friends should be known as having moved under control of the God of death.</p>
<p>On these persons the disease advances while the medicament becomes ineffective. One should not take food from them nor should touch even the water offered by them.</p>
<p>In11#25-26</p>
<p>The 4 legs of treatment endowed with effective properties even if combined together become useless in case of the patients having spent up their life-span because there can not be effect without a cause.</p>
<p>In11#27</p>
<p>The physician should examine the life-span of the healthy as well as the diseased. The entire fruit of knowledge continues in the physician having attained the same.</p>
<p>In11#28</p>
<p>The signs (or marks) produced by the dosas having transcended the remedial measures and which pervade the entire body are known as &#x27;arista&#x27; (fatal signs).</p>

<p>The patient on whose head a powdery substance like that of cow-dung powder</p>
<p>appears and on application of oils disappears, survives only by the end of the month.</p>
<p>In12#2</p>
<p>One who, due to morbidity, runs here and there with drooped shoulders and legs rubbing together does not live longer.</p>
<p>In12#4</p>
<p>The person whose chest goes dried up soon while all other parts are wet after bath and after paste, does not survive for a fortnight.</p>
<p>In12#5</p>
<p>The patient for whom the physician, in spite of his efforts, does not succeed in arranging the remedial measures, rarely survives.</p>
<p>In12#6</p>
<p><strong>If a remedy well-known, well-tried and administered properly does not succeed, the case may be considered as incurable.</strong></p>
<p>In12**#7**</p>
<p><strong>The patient who does not achieve the fruit of the diet taken even if it is well prepared under the guidance of the physician rarely survives.</strong></p>
<p>In12#8</p>
<p>Under the topic of the messenger, I shall mention the fatal signs observing which the physician should reject the case undoubtedly.</p>
<p>In12#9</p>
<p>The physician seeing the arrived messenger as disheveled or naked or weeping or inattentive should predict the death of the patient.</p>
<p>In12#10</p>
<p>If the messengers come while the physician is asleep or cutting or breaking (something), the physician should not accompany them to their master (the patient).</p>
<p>In12#11</p>
<p>If the messengers arrive when the physician is offering oblations to the fire or bolus to the forefathers, it indicates death of the patient.</p>
<p>In12#12</p>
<p>If messengers arrive when the physician is speaking or thinking about inauspicious things, the patient dies.</p>
<p>In12#13</p>
<p>If the messengers arrive when the physician is thinking or speaking about the dead, burnt or lost, or other inauspicious things, it indicates patient&#x27;s death.</p>
<p>In12#14</p>
<p>If the messenger comes in a place or a time similar to the disease in properties, the physician, they physician should not treat the patient.</p>
<p>In12#15</p>
<p>The messengers as anxious, frightened, hurried, terrorized and unclean; unchaste women, three in number, having deformities, or eunuch indicate death of the patient.</p>
<p>In12#16</p>
<p>If a physician observes a messenger having trouble in some organ, ascetic, diseased or engaged in harsh activities, he should not go with him.</p>
<p>In12#17</p>
<p>If a messenger of the patient comes on a cart carried by ass or camel, it indicates the patient&#x27;s succumbing to death.</p>
<p>In12#18</p>
<p>Before meeting (while waiting for) the physician, if the messenger touches straw, chaff, flesh, bone, hairs, body hairs, nail, teeth, broom, pounding rod, winnowing basket, shoes, fallen leather, grass, wood, husk, charcoal, earthen clod or stone, it indicates the death of the patient.</p>
<p>In12#19-20</p>
<p>If the physician comes across bad omen while the messenger is conveying the message about the patient, the physician should not go with him.</p>
<p>In12#21</p>
<p>If the physician, before, during or after receiving the message from the messenger, sees, somebody diseased, dead or adorned like a dead, or something broken, burnt or destroyed; hears similar words, perceives intensely pungent taste or stinky smell like that of corpse or exceedingly harsh touch or other inauspicious entities it indicates death of the patient.</p>
<p>In12#22-23</p>
<p>Thus the topic about the messengers of the dying patients is described. In12#24</p>
<p>Now I shall mention the portentous signs observed in the way or the patients&#x27; house. [[while the physician is traveling to the patient&#x27;s house.]]</p>
<p>Sneezing, crying, slipping, falling, angry expression, beating, refutation, despising;</p>
<p>Fall or defection of cloth, turban, upper garment, umbrella and shoes;</p>
<p>coming across the people afflicted due to death of somebody, falling down of sacred tree, flagstaff, flag or pitcher full of water;</p>
<p>talking about death or inauspicious things, pollution with ashes or dust, crossing of road by cat, dog or serpent;</p>
<p>cries of cruel animals and birds facing south, seeing cot, chair and vehicles stretched out–</p>
<p>These have been said as inauspicious by the learned.</p>
<p>In12#25-29</p>
<p>THE wise physician seeing or hearing these in the way should not proceed to the patient&#x27;s house. - In12#30</p>
<p>Thus are said the portentous signs observed in the way which are despised by the physicians.</p>
<p>In12#31</p>
<p>Physician should also observe the portentous condition of the patient&#x27;s house. Such as–</p>
<p>going out of full pitcher, fire, earth, sed, fruit, ghee, bull, brahmana, gems, food and idol of gods while the physician enters;</p>
<p>the physician while entering into the dying patient&#x27;s house sees the fire vessels as broken or flameless.</p>
<p>The family members of the moribund person use the things which are cut, split, burnt, broken, kneaded or weak.</p>
<p>The patient whose bed, clothes, vehicle, movement, eating ad bird&#x27;s perching are head as inauspicious is not curable.</p>
<p>The patient whose friends use beds, clothes, vehicles, or other accessories like dead bodies should himself be treated as dead.</p>
<p>While cooking food for the patient, if the food gets exceedingly damaged or the fire gets extinguished even though there is no wind and the fuel is sufficient, it indicates incurability of the patient.</p>
<p>In12#32-38</p>
<p>If earthen pots in the patient&#x27;s house fall down or get broken frequently, the chances of survival are rare.</p>
<p>In12#39</p>
<p>Whatever is described with details in 12 chapters in respect of the signs indicating death of the moribund persons will now be said in brief in other words.</p>
<p>To repeat something in a different way provides better understanding of the ideas.</p>
<p>It is not intended to repeat the same thing, too much in the same chapter, which has already been said earlier.</p>
<p>In12#40-42</p>
<p><strong>Now I will describe the symptoms and change in condition, as proposed and accepted in traditions, indicating departure of the self who having lived in the body for the maximum period [i.e., a natural, healthy death] prepares to migrate out of the body after relinquishing the beloved vital breath, giving up the beautiful abode and entering into the final darkness when all the systems and organs are disintegrated such as—</strong></p>
<p><strong>the vital breath is afflicted understanding is obstructed organs discharge strength activities recede senses are lost consciousness is isolated restlessness and fear enter into the mind memory and intellect leave away modesty and grace get away</strong></p>

<p><strong>head acquires fume and cow-dung-like powder</strong></p>
<p><strong>all the pulsating parts of the body get stiffened and devoid of pulsation</strong></p>
<p><strong>the qualities of body parts such as coldness-hotness, softness-hardness etc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>change with contrariety</strong></p>
<p><strong>nails get flowered teeth get muddened</strong></p>
<p><strong>eyelashes get matted</strong></p>
<p><strong>lines appear in head</strong></p>
<p><strong>drugs do not become available as desired</strong></p>
<p><strong>even if obtained they prove ineffective</strong></p>
<p><strong>many difficult diseases having various origins and remedies arise quickly by destroying the strength and ojas</strong></p>
<p><strong>during the course of treatment, inauspicious sound, touch, taste, vision, smell, activity and thoughts arise</strong></p>
<p><strong>fierce dreams appear</strong></p>
<p><strong>disposition of the patient changes on evil side</strong></p>
<p><strong>messengers show adverse signs</strong></p>
<p><strong>features of the dead come forth</strong></p>
<p><strong>normalcy goes down fastly while morbidity advances</strong></p>
<p><strong>all the portentous signs indicating death are observed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>–These are the signs of the moribund persons which have been said as proposed and accepted in tradition.</strong></p>
<p>In12#43-61</p>
<p>The physician, though observing the signs of death, should not disclose the approaching death without having been requested for. - In12#62</p>
<p>Even on request, he should not express it if it is liable to cause patient&#x27;s death or affliction to somebody else. - In12#63</p>
<p>The experienced physician, without expressing patient&#x27;s death should not be inclined to treat him after observing the fatal signs.</p>
<p>In12#64</p>
<p>In case the physician observes the signs as contrary to those of death, he should certainly tell about the approaching conditions of health as indicated by the favorable messengers, propitious signs in the way or the patient&#x27;s house, the conduct and behavior</p>
<p>of the patient and availability of the desired medicaments.</p>
<p>In12#65-66</p>
<p>The physician should consider the approaching messenger as auspicious if he is of good conduct, exhilarated, having not deformity or deficiency in body, praiseworthy, with white dress, head unshaved and without matting, similar in birth, dress and activity; coming on a cart not driven by camel or ass, not in early morning, evening, inauspicious or cruel stars or constellations, rikta tithis (vacant dates as 4th, 9th, and 14th date of the fortnight), noon, midnight, earthquake, solar or lunar eclipse, from inauspicious place, coming across portentous signs in the way and unperturbed state.</p>
<p>In12#67-70</p>
<p>Auspicious signs in the way are as follows–</p>
<p>seeing curd, barley, brahmanas, bulls, king, precious stones, full pitcher, white horse, flag staff or flag of temples, fruits, jhalf-boiled cereals, earthen saucers made in the form of girls and boys, one animal tied, ploughed land, kindled fire, white sweet balls and flowers, sandal, delicious food and drinks, cart full of human beings, milk cow, mare and women with her child;</p>
<p>cukor, siddhartha, sarasa (crane), priyavadi, swan, satapatra, blue jay, peacock, fish, goat, elephant tusk, conch, fruits of priyangu, ghee, ornaments of horses, mirror, yellow mustard, gorochana;</p>
<p>fragrant smell, white color, sweet taste, auspicious voice of animals, birds and human beings, unfolding of umbrella, flags and banners devotional songs, sound of kettle drums and conches, auspicious recitals, sounds of vedic recitation, soothing and favorable wind</p>
<p>In12#71-79</p>
<p>Auspicious signs in the patient&#x27;s house are as below–</p>
<p>the family members including the patient endowed with auspicious conduct, respectful, favorable, abundance of materials, attainment of wealth, superiority and happiness</p>
<p>acquisition of the desired object with ease</p>
<p>administration of useful drugs and success thereby</p>
<p>dreams of climbing on house, palace, hill, riding on elephants, bull, horse and men;</p>
<p>seeing the moon, the sun, fire, brahmanas</p>
<p>cows and women having lactation,</p>
<p>swimming of oceans</p>
<p>advancement</p>
<p>getting out of difficulty</p>
<p>talk with pleased gods and forefathers</p>
<p>seeing white clothes</p>
<p>clean tank [swimming pool]</p>
<p>receiving meat, fish, poison, unclean objects, umbrella and mirror, white flowers, journey on cart driven by horse and bull, journey to the east and the north, weeping, rising after fall and subduing enemies.</p>
<p>In12#80-86</p>
<p>Presence of the symptoms of good psyche, devotion to physician and brahmanas,</p>
<p>curability of the disease, absence of frustration–</p>
<p>these are the signs of the recovery from illness.</p>
<p>When the patient is free from illness the man having auspicious signs, attains strength, long life-span and great happiness and other desired objects.</p>
<p>In12#87-88</p>
<p>In this chapter the signs of death and recovery have been described in respect of messengers, dreams, patient&#x27;s conduct, portentous signs, administration of drugs and success.</p>
<p>In12#89</p>
<p>Thus this context has been explained properly which should be constantly examined by the physician. In12#90</p>
<p>By this he attains success, standing reputation and wealth because of his success in the profession. In12#90</p>
<p>Here ends the section on the signs of life and death.</p>

<p>For those having exalted mind, qualities and actions the crops grew endowed with inconceivable rasa, virya, vipaka, prabhava, and other properties due to presence of all qualities in earth etc (the five elements?) In the beginning of Krtayuga.</p>
<p>Vi3#24</p>
<p>At the declining of krtayuga: due to over-receiving (see calendar for definition of this term) there arose heaviness in bodies of these wealthy persons; heaviness of the body led to fatigue, lassitude, hoarding, holding and greed, in successive order.</p>
<p>In Tretayuga: greed gave rise to malice, speaking lie, passion, anger, conceit, dislike, roughness, violence, fear, infliction, grief, anxiety, excitement, etc. successively.</p>
<p>In treta, a quarter of righteousness disappeared due to which there was reduction of a quarter in the yearly duration of the yugas (ages) and consequent degradation of quarter in unctuousness, purity, rasa, vipaka, prabhava and other properties of the crops. Because of this the bodies of the people due to intake of food degraded by a quarter inproperties and other behaviors were not resistant as earlier and as such were pervaded</p>
<p>by pitta and vata and were attacked first by diseases like fever etc.. Thus the living beings were gradually affected by decrease in their life-span. -Vi3#24</p>
<p>In yuga after yuga a quarter of righteousness is reduced in this order along with similar reduction in the qualities of living beings leading finally to dissolution of the universe. After completion of 100 years, there is a loss of 1 year in the lifespan of the living beings in respective ages. Thus is said the initial origin of disorders. - Vi3#25-27</p>

<p>O gentle one! There are observed the abnormal conditions of stars, planets, moon, sun, air and fire and also of the environment which derange the seasons too. Shortly hereafter the earth too will not provide properly rasa, virya, vipaka an prabhava to herbs, consequently, due to absence of these requisite properties spread of diseases is certain.</p>
<p>Hence before destruction and loss of nutrients in the earth, O gentle one! Extract the herbs lest they should lose their rasa, virya, vipaka and prabhava. We shall make use of these properties-rasa, virya, vipaka and prabhava for those who are devoted to us and whom we like, because there will not be any difficulty in counteracting the epidemic disorders if the drugs are well-collected, well-processed and well-administered.</p>
<p>Vi3#4</p>
<p>Why does an epidemic effect everyone in a community? Even though people differ in constitution, strength, age, etc., they may all succumb to the epidemic, due to 4 factors which become deranged. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">
<ol>
<li class="">Air,</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li class="">
<ol start="2">
<li class="">Water,</li>

</ol>
</li>
<li class="">
<ol start="4">
<li class="">Time. -Vi3#16</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;They are important in PROGRESSIVE order because of the degree of their indispensability&quot; -Vi3#9-11</p>
<p>Again: Deranged air, water, place and time are the cause of epidemics. Vi3#7</p>
<p>Air: causing illness; not in accordance with the season, excessively moist, speedy, harsh, cold, hot, rough, blocking, terribly sounding; excessively clashing with each other, whistling, and affected with unsuitable smell, vapor, gravels, dust and smoke. -Vi3#6.1</p>
<p>Water: is devoid of merits when it is excessively deranged in respect of smell, color, taste and touch, is too slimy, deserted by aquatic birds, aquatic animals are reduced and is unpleasing. -Vi3#6.2</p>
<p>Place (land): it&#x27;s normal color, smell, taste and touch is too much affected, it contains excessive moisture, is troubled by reptiles, violent animals, mosquitoes, locusts, flied, rats, owls, vultures, jackals, etc.., has groves of grasses an creepers and abundance of diffusing plants (i.e. kudzu? Or i.e. ragweed?); has a new look, has fallen, dried and damaged crops, smoky winds; crying out of birds and dogs; bewilderment and painful condition of various animals and birds; the community with abandoned and destroyed virtue, truthfulness, modesty, conduct, behavior and other merits; the rivers constantly agitated and over-flooded, frequent occurrence of meteorites, thunderbolts, and earthquakes, fierce and crying appearance; the sun, the moon and the stars with rough, coppery, reddish, white and cloudy appearance frequently; as if filled with confusion and excitement, torture, crying and darkness with frequent crying sound as if seized by guhyaka. -Vi3#6.3</p>
<p>Time: should be known as contrary if it is having signs contrary, excessive or deficient to those of the season. (I.e. a drought during the rainy season, or and excessively cold winter.)</p>
<p>Vi3#6.4</p>
<p>Even when these 4 epidemic-producing factors are present, a person who has been properly treated with preventative care will be immune against the diseases.</p>

<p>The people do not suffer, if managed with preventive therapy. For those who have no similarity in either death or previous deeds, pancakarma is the best treatment. Thereafter proper use of rasayana measures and management with the drug collected previously is recommended.</p>
<p>Truthfulness, benevolence, charity, offerings, worship of gods, observance of noble&#x27;s conduct, calmness, self-protection, residence in healthy places, observance of celibacy and company of those who are observing celibacy, discourse of religious scriptures, narratives of self-controlled great sages, constant company with religious, pure and those regarded by the elders-this is the management for the protection of life FOR THOSE WHOSE DEATH IS NOT CERTAIN during that difficult period.</p>

<p>The root cause of all V, P, K is unrighteousness. That also arises from the misdeeds of previous life but the source of both is intellectual error. Such as -when the heads of the country, city, guild, and community having transgressed the virtuous path</p>
<p>deal unrighteously with the people, their officers and subordinates, people of the city and community, and traders carry this unrighteousness further. Thus this unrighteousness by force makes the righteousness disappear. Then the people with righteousness having disappeared, unrighteousness has the upper hand and the gods have deserted the place, the seasons get affected and because of this it does not rain in time, or at all or there is abnormal rainfall, winds do not blow properly, the land is affected, water reservoirs get fried up and the herbs giving up their natural propertied acquire morbidity. Then epidemics break out due to polluted contacts and edibles. -Vi3#20</p>
<p>Unrighteousness is the cause of the destruction of the community by weapons:</p>
<p>Those who have excessively increased greed, anger, attachment and conceit, disregarding the weak attack each other, or their enemies or are attacked by their enemies resulting in loss of themselves, their kinsmen and enemies. -Vi3#21</p>
<p>They are also attacked by the raksasas etc. or other organisms due to that unrighteousness or other unwholesome act. -Vi3#22</p>
<p>Unrighteousness is the cause of the disease arisen due to cursing:</p>
<p>Those with righteousness disappeared or moved away from righteousness, behave in unwholesome manner disregarding the good advice from preceptor, elders, accomplished ones, sages and other respectable persons. Consequently those people having been cursed by the preceptors, etc. are reduced to ashes immediately with many families along with the other individuals who are cursed so.</p>

<p>Prajnaparadha: intellectual error (in use of speech, mind, and body)</p>
<p>Excessive use of: too much application.</p>
<p>Negative use of: non-use of.</p>
<p>Perverted use of: holding up or forcing of urges, sleeping, falling and posturing on uneven places, abnormal posturing, heating, pressing, obstructing breath and torturing</p>
<p>Perverted use of speech: words of betrayal, lying, untimely speech, quarrel, unliking irrelevance, indiscipline, harshness, etc..</p>
<p>Perverted use of mind: fear, grief, anger, greed, confusion, conceit, envy, wrong knowledge</p>
<p>Su11#36-40</p>
<p>There are 3 causes of disorders– excessive, negative and perverted uses of senseobjects, actions and time. Such as- excessive gazing at the over-brilliant objects is excessive use, avoiding looking altogether is negative use and seeing too near, too distant, fierce, frightful, wonderful, disliked, disgusting, deformed and terrifying objects is perverted use of visual objects. Likewise, to hear too much the loud sound of clouds, drums, cries etc. is excessive use; not at all hearing is negative use and hearing of harsh and frightful words and those which indicate death of dear ones, loss, humiliation etc. is perverted use of auditory objects. Too much smelling of too sharp, intense and congestant odors is excessive use, not at all smelling is negative sue and smelling of fetid, disliked, impure, decomposed, poisoned air, cadaverous odor etc. is perverted use of olfactory objects. Likewise, too much intake of rasas (tastes) is excessive use, not at all taking is negative use of gustatory objects. Perverted use of those will be described in the chapter dealing with the methods of eating except the quantity. Too much indulgence in very hot and very cool objects and also in bath, massage, anointing etc. is excessive use of tactile objects; total abstinence from them is negative use and application of tactile objects such as hot and cold bath etc. without the usual order and also the touch of uneven surface, injury, dirty objects, organisms etc. is perverted use of tactile object.</p>
<p>Su11#37</p>
<p>So the condition of all the sense organs produced by the overall tactile sensation, when they are harmful, is known as unwholesome conjunction of sense organs and it&#x27;s objects which is of 5 types each having 3 sub-divisions. The objects which are accepted properly are known as wholesome ones.</p>
<p>Su11#38</p>
<p>Action is application of speech, mind and body. Too much application of these is excessive use and their total non-application is negative use. Holding up or forcing of urges, sleeping, falling and posturing on uneven places, abnormal posturing, heating, pressing, obstructing breath and torturing is the perverted use of bodily actions. Words indicating betrayal, lying, untimely speech, quarrel, unliking, irrelevance, indiscipline and harshness etc. come under the perverted use of speech. Fear, grief, anger, greed, confusion, conceit, envy, wrong knowledge is the perverted use of mind.</p>
<p>Su11#39</p>
<p>In short, any other harmful action of speech, mind and body which has not been mentioned above, should be taken as their perverted use.</p>
<p>(Of course if they are excessive or negative uses they should be taken in those respective categories.)</p>

<p>Lifespan of Humans:</p>
<p>Life-span may be determined.</p>
<p>The stability of life-span of all living beings depends on their personal daiva and purusakara.</p>
<p>-Vi3#29-32</p>
<p>2 Factors effecting Life-span:</p>

<p>Purusakara: deed self-done in the present life</p>

<p>Superior Daiva and Superior Purusakara together results in a long, happy and &#x27;determined&#x27; [semi-guaranteed to be long] life-span.</p>
<p>Inferior Daiva and Inferior Purusakara together result in a short, unhappy and un-determined [no guarantee on continued life or strength] life-span.</p>
<p>Medium grade Daiva and Medium grade Purusakara result in a medium life-span, moderate happiness and somewhat-determined life-span.</p>
<p>Vi3#29-32</p>
<p>Relevant Dominance:</p>
<p>Weak Daiva may be subdued by Purusakara (which is stronger). But by distinguished Daiva, Purusakara is subdued.</p>

<p>An axle fitted in a vehicle which is endowed with all the natural quantities carries on and perishes in time by depreciation of it&#x27;s normal limit; similarly, the life-span in a body of a person having strong constitution and managed properly gets it&#x27;s end and loss of its normal limit. Such death is known as timely. On the other hand, the same axle gets destroyed in the way due to overload, uneven road, want of road, breaking of wheels, defects in vehicle or driver, separation of the bolt, non-lubrication and throwing about, similarly the life-span comes to end in the middle.</p>

<p>[...Weak daiva is subdued by the stronger purusakara. Likewise, by the distinguished daiva purusakara is subdued...] Observing this some hold the determined span of life, but, in fact, some superior deeds exhibit results determined in time while others have such determination in time. This is known by observation.</p>
<p>Vi3#33-35</p>
<p>Hence because both types of causes are observed one-sided view is not correct. I will explain it with examples. If there be determined life-span for all there would not be any necessity to apply mantras, herb-roots, gems, auspicious rites, offerings, gifts, oblations, observance of rules, expiation, fasting, blessings, bowing, visit to temples etc. with a desire for longevity nor there be any need to avoid excited, fierce and moving cows, elephants, camels, asses, horses, buffalo and terrific winds etc. Likewise, one would not abstain from water falls, mountains, uneven and difficult places and strong water current, from careless, insane, excited, fierce and unstable persons and those inflicted with confusion and greed; from enemies, from furious fire, from various poisonous reptiles, serpents etc. from over-exertion, from behavior unsuited to place and time, and from king&#x27;s wrath, because these and other similar factors should not be destructive because of entire life having been determined span. Moreover, the living beings who have not practiced the alleviative measures against the happening of untimely death should not be subjected to such happening; all the talks of great sages for initiation</p>
<p>and knowledge of application in the chapter of rasayana [Chikitsasthana; in context of treatment of specific diseases] would be useless; even Indra should not be able to kill with thunderbolt his enemy with determined life-span; why should Aswins treat the patient with therapeutic measure? Why should the great sages try to obtain the desired life-span by penance? It would also not be necessary for the great sages along with the lord of the gods (Indra), who already know all that is worth knowing, to ses, to instruct and to behave properly.</p>
<p>Excellent among all the visions is the one pertaining to Indra, which is possessed by us as well, with this it is observed like this– there is dissimilarity in life-span of thousands of persons who are those not indulged in fighting battles; similarly in those who counteract or do not counteract the disease immediately after it is arisen; there is also dissimilarity in life-span of those who take poison or not; there is no similar fate of the jars carrying water and those in pictures (or kept only for decoration). Hence wholesome regimen is the basis of life and the contrary is that of death. Over and above, orderly and proper use of food and activities which are contrary to the properties of place, time and self, abstaining from excessive, negative and perverted use in respect of all (time, action and senses), holding up of psychic excesses (emotions), non-suppression of natural impelled urges, avoidance of over-exertion we take these as the cause for continuance of health and accordingly also instruct and observe properly.</p>
<p>Vi3#36</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="on-life-span">(on Life-span):<a href="#on-life-span" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to (on Life-span):" title="Direct link to (on Life-span):" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>My view on existence and non-existence of timely and untimely death is like this– some say whoever dies does so in time because there is no gap in time. This is not correct as there is no point in discussion about the gap or otherwise with regard to time because time has got its own characters due to nature. Others say– when somebody dies is his fixed death time. Death is true for all beings because of equal dealing. This also is wrong interpretation of fact. Equal dealing does not mean that there is none who does not die. The present context is the time which relates to the span of life. If one holds that the time when somebody dies is the time of death for him, then according to this all entities would be determined in respect of time but this is not correct because it is observed that the result of untimely food, speech and action is harmful otherwise useful. Moreover, there is clear usage of &quot;time&quot; and &quot;un-time&quot; in relation to different conditions and entities such as– this is the time or not for this disease, food, medicament, therapy and remission. Even in common usage they say- it rains timely or untimely, this cold weather is timely or untimely, that heat spell is untimely or untimely, flowering and fruiting of plants is happening in time or otherwise and so on. Hence both are true– timely death and untimely death. There is no scope for any exclusive view. If there be no untimely death and all would have determined life-span, then in that case there would not be any purpose of the knowledge of the wholesome and the un-wholesome. Over and above, perception, inference and testimony would not be recognized as means of valid knowledge which are recognized as such in all the scriptures and which provide knowledge about the factors conducive or otherwise to life-span. Therefore, the sages hold the view that there is no untimely death is only a jugglery of words.</p>

<p>heavy, rough, cold, dry, disliked, distending, burning, unclean, antagonistic, taken untimely, and also while afflicted by emotions (passion, anger, greed, confusion, envy, bashfulness, grief, conceit, excitement and fear). -Vi2#8</p>
<p>Food which is harmful to the channels, and which is disliked is certainly not at all desirable. -Su25-45</p>
<p>Even wholesome food taken improper quantity does not get digested if there is anxiety, grief, fear, anger, uncomfortable &#x27;bed&#x27; [or chair/ couch], or vigil [not sleeping/ not resting].</p>
<p>Vi2#9</p>
<p>Food or any other thing which is liked but is unwholesome and with unpleasant consequences should not be used by carelessness or ignorance.</p>
<p>Vi1#23</p>
<p>Making an Offering: One should offer regularly wholesome food and drinks to &quot;antaragni&quot;;( internal fire) with due consideration to quantity and time. One who offers oblation to an external fire as well as the food oblations to the internal fire, as well as right conduct, doesn&#x27;t get sick.</p>
<p>Su27#345-347</p>
<p>The best foods to be taken regularly through life:</p>
<p>rice, pulses, rock salt, fruits, barley, rain water, milk, ghee, honey.</p>
<p>Requirements of Wholesome food: consumed properly by the Agnis, &quot;participating in the non-stopping process of all dhatus (metabolism) like time&quot; and which doesn&#x27;t effect the dhatu agnis, V and channels, -Su28#3</p>
<p>The food which maintains the balanced dhatus in normalcy and restores the equilibrium in mal-balanced ones should be taken as wholesome. The other food is unwholesome.</p>
<p>That which is not harmful to the paths of the body and is according to liking (the patient should enjoy the food !) is called &quot;Pathya&quot; (wholesome). The other food is unwholesome.</p>
<p>Su25#45</p>
<p>&quot;It is not possible to derive entire beneficial results of food only on the basis of it&#x27;s quantity because all the &quot;8 factors of dieting&quot; (see chart) have their &quot;divided&quot; [significant] effects.&quot; In other words, it&#x27;s not just HOW MUCH you eat, but WHAT you eat.</p>
<p>One should not eat foods out of either attachment or ignorance; rather he should eat the wholesome food after examination, because the body is a product of food.&quot; Su28#41</p>
<p>Results of Wholesome Food:</p>
<p>endows the body with development, strength, luster, and happy life, and provides energy to the body tissues</p>

<p>Food and drinks with desirable smell, taste and touch and having been taken according to prescribed method is IS SAID AS VITAL STRENGTH by the experts</p>
<p>This was deduced on the basis of observing their results directly.</p>
<p>The reason is because the condition of internal fire depends on food and drinks for it&#x27;s fuel.</p>
<p>Food and drinks produce energy in mind, constitution of dhatus, strength, complexion and clarity of sense organs, if properly taken.</p>
<p>Otherwise they become harmful.</p>

<p>When one eats solid food up to the saturation point [feeling &#x27;full&#x27;] and then drinks &quot;liquids up to the same&quot; [equal portion as the solid foods], the 3 doshas which normally reside in the stomach are pressed too much by the excess quantity of food. Thus the 3 doshas get vitiated simultaneously.</p>
<p>These vitiated doshas enter into [/mix with] the food and get located in a &quot;portion of the belly&quot;.</p>
<p>From here they may cause the following symptoms:</p>
<p>distention of the abdomen, or sudden dosha elimination via vomiting or diarrhea. V produces colic pain, hardness in belly, body-ache, dryness of mouth, fainting, giddiness, irregularity of digestion, stiffness in side, back and waist, constriction and spasm in blood vessels. P produces fever, diarrhea, internal heat, thirst, narcosis, giddiness and delirium. K produces vomiting, anorexia, indigestion, fever with cold, lassitude and heaviness in body.</p>
<p>Vi2#7</p>
<p>***Visusika and Alasaka (diarrhea/vomiting and constipation due to Amavisa/Ama) Described, along with trtmnt, on pg. 311-312; may be worth it to include (at least include in &quot;Grahaniroga&quot; Chapter).***</p>
<p>Vi2#11-13</p>
<p>The qualities of lightness and heaviness in food articles are not inert [due merely to different mass/ density of the food articles].</p>
<p>In fact, light articles are predominant in properties of vayu (air element) and agni (fire element), while the heavy articles are predominant in prthivi (earth element) and soma (ap) (water element).</p>
<p>So, by dint of their properties, these light articles are stimulant of digestion. And even when taken up to the saturation point [full stomach], they produce little</p>
<p>derangement.</p>
<p>On the contrary the heavy articles are dissimilar in nature to the nature of the body&#x27;s digestive fire. Thus heavy foods are not by nature stimulant of digestion.</p>
<p>If the heavy foods are taken up to saturation point, they cause considerable derangement.</p>
<p>There is an exception; in persons doing physical exercise and[/or] who have very strong agni (digestive fire), heavy foods taken even up to saturation point won&#x27;t cause excess derangement.</p>
<p>So, the quantity of food per meal which will produce derangement is relative to that person&#x27;s &quot;Agnibala&quot; (power of digestion).</p>
<p>Su5#6</p>
<p>It is not so that the article itself has no importance in this respect. In fact considering the property of the article, the intake of heavy ones is advised as 1/3 or ½ of the saturation point [till stomach is 1/3 to ½ full] [till agni, determined by observing appetite, is diminished by 1/3 to 1/2] and not excessive saturation even in case of light articles [i.e., light foods may be taken up to the saturation point, i.e, till the stomach is full] in order to maintain the proper strength of agni.</p>

<p><em>Oil possesses the properties of unctuousness, hotness and heaviness and as such overcomes V by regular use. V possesses roughness, coldness and lightness and as such is contrary in properties. When the contraries meet together the stronger one subdues the weaker one, hence oil overcomes V by regular use. In the same way, ghee overcomes P due to sweetness, coldness and dullness because P is non-sweet, hot and sharp. Honey overcomes K due to roughness, sharpness and astringency because K is unctuous, dull and sweet.

<p>The wise, in case of a disease, gets relief by external or internal or surgical measures. The childish, due to confusion or carelessness do not know about the emerging disorder in early stage as fools about the enemy. The disorder, though having a minute start, advances afterwards and gradually becoming deep-rooted takes away the strength and life of the foolish one. The fool does not realize till he is afflicted and only then he decides to control the disease. Then he collects son, wife and kin and requests them to bring some physician even at the cost of his entire possession, but who can save</p>
<p>him, the devoid of life, weak, afflicted, emaciated, anxious and with the sense organs waned away. Thus not finding a savior that fool leaves his life like an iguana with her tail bound and dragged by a strong person. Hence one, who wishes happiness, should counteract with medicines before the disorder is produced or when it is newly arisen.</p>

<p>There are 3 types of therapy– spiritual, rational and psychological. The spiritual therapy consists of- recitation of mantras, wearing roots and gems, auspicious acts, offerings, gifts, oblations, following religious precepts, atonement, fasting, invoking blessings, falling on the feet of the gods, pilgrimage etc.</p>
<p>The rational therapy consists of rational administration of diet and drugs. The psychological therapy is restraint of mind from the unwholesome objects. Su11#54</p>

<p>Qualities of behavior and diet should be opposite to the qualities of place and disorders.</p>
<p>Su6#50</p>
<p>Treat a diseased person with disease-alleviating therapy, the wasted with anti-wasting therapy; saturate the emaciated and weak, de-saturate the plumpy and obese, treat the person afflicted with heat with cold therapy and the person afflicted with cold with hot therapy, compensate the depleted dhatus and reduce the increased dhatus. Thus by treating the disorders with therapy which is opposite to the causative factor we reestablish the normalcy well.</p>
<p>The therapeutic measures help us achieve these actions.</p>

<h1>Use of Rasas for the person with equilibrium of dhatus:</h1>

<h1>Importance of Informed Use of Drugs, Herbs:</h1>
<p>A drug, if unknown, is fatal like poison, weapon, fire and thunderbolt while, if known, is vitalizer like nectar. A drug unknown by these– name, form and properties (including actions)- and badly administered even if known are responsible for complications.</p>
<p>Su1#124-125</p>
<p>A sharp poison also becomes the best drug by proper administration, but on the other hand even the best drug is reduced to sharp poison, if administered badly. Hence, the wise person desiring for long life and health should not take any medicine administered by irrational physician (quack). Indra&#x27;s thunderbolt, even when fallen on head, may let somebody survive but the medicine prescribed by the ignorant physician cant&#x27; make a patient survive. Regarding himself as wise who, without knowing, administers medicines to the afflicted, bedridden, faithful patient; man falls into hell even on talking with this physician devoid of virtue, sinner, personified death and wicked. The serpent poison is good or the intake of decocted copper or the swallowing of red hot iron balls but the acceptance of medicine from one putting on the robe of scholars is not at all good. Receiving food, drink or money from the surrendered patient is also not proper.</p>

<p>The physician should examine [1)] the disease first and then [2)] the drug and thereafter [3)] the management.</p>
<p>He should always proceed with prior knowledge.</p>
<p>The physician who without knowing the disease starts it&#x27;s treatment succeeds by chance even if he is well versed in management with drugs. The one who knows the characters of disease, is well versed in all therapeutic measures and is acquainted with the proper measure of place and time succeeds undoubtedly.</p>
<p>Su20#20-22</p>
<p>Proper administration (of drugs) depends on dose and time and success is based on proper administration.</p>

<p>All the measures meant for pacifying disorders even if useful do not pacify the same if they are applied in excessive or deficient degree, contrary time and due to faulty management.</p>
<p>Si1#59</p>
<p>The wise should not go blindly by the sayings even if they are stated as conclusive ones but he should use his own rational thinking because condition may arise according to place, time and strength in which the non-prescribed measure becomes applicable and the prescribed one is contra-indicated. For instance, emesis is prescribed for vomiting, heart disease and gulma according to condition in their respective treatment as also enema for those suffering from kustha. [[These therapies are normally contraindicated for these conditions/ can cause these conditions]] hence in spite of instructions one should act by thinking with his own intellect.

<p>Alasaka: indigestion symptoms accompanied by constipation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Etiology: food + drinks taken by the weak, one with poor digestion and abundant K , who suppresses urges of flatus, urine, and feces, and takes solid, heavy, excessively rough, cold and dry food;</p>
<p>Pathology: the excess ingested food gets pressed by V, and their passage being blocked by K and also due to excessively accumulated excreta does not tend to come out;</p>
<p>Symptoms: then they exhibit excessively the symptoms of Ama <em>except</em> vomiting and diarrhoea.</p>
<p>Complications: Aggravated doshas, blocked by Ama, may move obliquely, and stiffen the whole body (this is called Dandalasaka, and is incurable). -this whole heading Vi2#12</p>

<p>[Notes: this chart is titled &quot;3 types of desaturation&quot; and refers to the process for removing any one of the 3 dosas. However, is it primarily for K and P, since</p>
<p>V is desaturated in nature already? Or does this apply to V also. Meditate on this, using practical examples.]</p>
<p>[Well, look at action of &#x27;Reducing&#x27;: Agni and V are actually used as the agents of action. However, I may have mis-interpreted &#x27;vayu&#x27; as V instead of the intended Air Element..]</p>

<p>The physician, who wants to administer emetic or purgative to a king, a kingly or a wealthy person, has to arrange the necessary equipments before-hand, in order to provide pleasure in case of the drug working successfully, and in order to provide counter-action in case complications arise.</p>
<p>Because it is not possible to arrange for the proper drugs easily and immediately, in spite of the arrangement of sale and import, in case an emergency occurs, the necessary supplies should be gathered at hand from the start of treatment.</p>
<p>Su15#3</p>
<p>Lord Atreya&#x27;s student asked him why it is necessary to prepare for complications if a physician is good-enough to do the treatment correctly the first time. Atreya replies:</p>
<p>&quot;It is possible for me or person like me to counteract in such a way that the entire treatment succeeds invariably and I am also able to teach others these proper methods, but there is no student who is bright-enough to receive these instructions or to thereafter make right decisions in the cases. The variations in condition of morbidity, drug, place, time, strength, body, diet, suitability, mind, constitution and age are quite subtle which, while being considered, confuse the mind of even great scholars, so, needless to say it confuses the minds of the average person.&quot;</p>

<p>He is the real physician who knows the timely application of reducing, promoting, roughening, uncting, sweating and checking measures.</p>
<p>Su22#3-8</p>
<p>Whatever produces lightness in the body is known as &quot;langhana&quot; (reducing therapy).</p>
<p>Whatever produces bulk of the body is known as &quot;brmhana&quot; (promoting therapy).</p>
<p>&quot;Ruksana&quot; (roughening) is that which produces roughness, coarseness and nonsliminess.</p>
<p>&quot;Snehana&quot; (unction) is that which produces unction, oozing, softness and moistening.</p>
<p>&quot;Swedana&quot; (sweating) produces sweat and alleviates stiffness, heaviness and cold.</p>
<p>&quot;Stambhana&quot; (checking therapy) is that which checks the movement of mobile substances.</p>
<p>The drug possessing: light, hot, sharp, non-slimy, rough, minute, coarse, unstable and hard properties has got mostly the reducing effect.</p>
<p>The drug possessing heavy, cold, soft, unctuous, solid, gross, slimy, dull, stable and smooth properties is mostly promoting in effect.</p>
<p>Rough, light, coarse, sharp, hot, stable, non-slimy and hard drug is mostly roughening in effect.</p>
<p>Liquid, minute, non-stable, unctuous, slimy, heavy, cold, dull and soft drug is mostly uncting in effect.</p>
<p>Hot, sharp, unstable, unctuous, rough, minute, liquid and stable drug is mostly sweating in effect.</p>
<p>Cold, dull, soft, smooth, rough, minute, liquid, stable and light drug is mostly checking in effect.</p>
<p>Su22#9-17</p>
<p>Reducing therapy may be applied in various forms such as 4 types of evacuation, thirst, exposure to wind and the sun, digestive measures, fasting and physical exercise. Su22#18</p>
<p>Those having big body and strength, abundant K, P, blood and excreta, and association of aggravated V should be subjected to reducing therapy by means of evacuation.</p>
<p>Those afflicted with the diseases of moderate severity and caused by K and P like vomiting, diarrhea, heart disease, cholera, alasaka, fever, constipation, heaviness, eructation, nausea, anorexia etc. should mostly be treated with digestives in the beginning</p>
<p>by the learned physician.</p>
<p>These very diseases, when with little severity, should be overcome with control of thirst and fasting.</p>
<p>The diseases of moderate and little severity in strong persons should be treated with physical exercise and exposure to the sun and wind.</p>
<p>The persons suffering from skin disorders, diabetes and those using excess of unctuous, channel-blocking and promoting diet and also patients of V disorders should be subjected to reducing therapy in sisira (late winter).</p>
<p>Su22#19-24</p>
<p>Undamaged meat of &quot;ault&quot; [[adult]] animals, fish and birds living in suitable environments and killed with non-poisonous weapons is the best promoting one.</p>
<p>The persons wasted, wounded, lean, old, weak, constantly traveling on foot and indulged in women and wine and also in the summer are suitable for promoting therapy. For those suffering from consumption, piles, disorders of grahani and wasted by other similar diseases, the light meat soup of carnivorous animals is the best promoting one.</p>
<p>Bath, annointing, sleep, enema with sweet and unctuous substances, sugar, milk and ghee are universal promoters.</p>
<p>Su22#25-28</p>
<p>Roughening therapy consists of the regular intake of pungent, bitter and astringent articles, sexual acts and use of <strong>oil-cakes</strong>, buttermilk and honey etc.</p>
<p>The roughening therapy is indicated in the diseases which are caused by blocking of channels, strong dosas and are located in vital parts and in urustambha (stiffening of the thighs) etc.</p>
<p>Unction, persons suitable for unction, sweating and persons suitable for sweating are explained in their own chapters.</p>
<p>Su22#29-31</p>
<p>All the drugs and measures consisting of liquid, thin, stable, cooling and having sweet, bitter and astringent tastes constitute the checking therapy.</p>
<p>It is indicated in P, burns with alkali and fire, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive application of poisons and sweating.</p>
<p>Su22#32-33</p>
<p>The roughening therapy should be regarded as properly administered when there is proper elimination of wind, urine and feces, lightness in body, cleansing of heart, eructation, throat and mouth, disappearance of drowsiness and exhaustion, appearance of sweat, relish and <strong>both hunger and thirst together</strong>, and also the feeling of well-being.</p>
<p>Pain in joints, body-ache, cough, dryness of mouth, loss of hunger, anorexia, thirst, weakness of hearing and vision, confusion of mind, frequent eructations, feeling of darkness, loss of weight, digestive power and strength– these are the symptoms of excessive reducing therapy.</p>
<p>Su22#34-37</p>
<p>On proper administration of promoting therapy one gets strength and corpulence and gives up the defects of the lean.</p>
<p>On excessive application of promotive therapy one suffers from obesity.</p>
<p>The symptoms of proper and excessive administration of roughening therapy are the same as those of the reducing therapy.</p>
<p>Su22#38</p>
<p>The checking therapy is regarded as properly administered when the disorders are overcome and strength is gained.</p>
<p>On excessive application of the checking therapy the patient is afflicted with blackishness, stiffness in body parts, uneasiness, lockjaw, and obstruction in heart (function) and excretion of feces.</p>
<p>Su22#39-40</p>
<p>All these therapies should be known generally as not adequately administered when the treated dosas are not pacified rather are aggravated.</p>
<p>Thus the 6 therapeutic measures useful in all disorders and which are tried in treatment of the curable disorders in accordance with dose and time are said.</p>
<p>Su22#41-42</p>
<p>Due to various combinations of dosas, the therapies also get mixed up but even then they do not go beyond the 6 (numbers) like the dosas not transgressing the 3 (numbers).</p>
<p>Su22#43</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-8-despicables">The 8 Despicables<a href="#the-8-despicables" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The 8 Despicables" title="Direct link to The 8 Despicables" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In the context of body, 8 persons are despicable such as– over-tall, over-short, over-hairy, hairless, over-black, over-fair, over-obese, and over-lean. Su21#3</p>
<p>Among them, the over-obese and the over-lean have other despicable features too. The over-obese has 8 defects– shortening of life-span, hampered movement, difficulty in sexual intercourse, debility, foul smell, over-sweating, too much hunger and excessive thirst. Over-obesity is caused by over-saturation, intake of heavy, sweet, cold and fatty diet, indulgence in day-sleeping and exhilaration, lack of mental work and genetic defect. There is excess of fat in him and further only fat is accumulated and not the other dhatus so, thus the life-span is shortened; because of laxity, softness and heaviness of fat there is hampering in movement; due to non-abundance of semen and the passage having been covered with fat, there is difficulty in sexual intercourse; due to disequilibrium of dhatus there is debility; foul smell is due to defect and nature of fat and also sweating, due to association of medas with K, it&#x27;s oozing nature, abundance, heaviness and intolerance to physical exercise there is over-sweating; because of intensified agni (digestion) and abundance of V in the belly there is excessive hunger and thirst.</p>
<p>Su21#4</p>
<p>V, due to passage having been obstructed with fat, moves about abundantly in belly and thus stimulates digestion and absorbs food. Hence the person digests food quickly and desires excessively the intake of food. In case of delay in taking food he is afflicted with some severe disorders. These 2- agni and V- are particularly complicating and as such burn the obese like the forest fire burning the forest. In the event of excessive increase of fat, the dosas suddenly give rise to severe disorders and thus destroy the life shortly. The person is called as over-obese who, due to excessive increase of fat and muscles, has pendulous buttocks, abdomen and breasts and suffers from deficient metabolism and energy. Thus is described the defects, cause and symptoms of the obese.</p>
<p>Su21#3-9</p>
<p>Hereafter, the features of the over-lean will be explained. Indulgence in rough food and drinks, fasting, little diet, excessive subjection to evacuative therapy, grief, suppression of natural urges including those of sleep, non-unctuous anointing in rough persons, indulgence in bath, constitution [having a lean or V-type body since birth], old age, continued disorder and anger make a person over-lean. The over-lean does not tolerate physical exercise, over-saturation, hunger, thirst, disease and drugs and also too much cold, heat and sexual intercourse. The over-lean often becomes a victim of spleen (enlargement), cough, wasting, dyspnea, gaseous tumor, piles, abdominal diseases and also the disorders of grahani. The over-lean is the person who has dried up [too small] buttocks, abdomen and neck; prominent vascular network; only remnant of skin and bone and with thick nodes.</p>
<p>Su21#10-15</p>
<ul>
<li class="">* The over-obese and the over-lean are constantly indisposed and as such have to be managed constantly with bulk-reducing and bulk-promoting measures respectively.</li>
<li class="">* Out of the obese and the lean, the lean person is better off because, though they have equal means, the obese person is more afflicted if some disease arises.</li>
</ul>
<p>Su21#16-17</p>
<p>* The person having balanced proportion of muscles, compactness and firmness in organs does not fall prey to prowess of a disorder. The person having balanced musculature has good tolerance for hunger, thirst, the sun, cold and exercise; balanced agni (digestion) and normal metabolism.</p>
<p>Su21#18-19</p>
<p>* For reducing the bulk of the obese, heavy and non-saturating while for promoting the bulk of the lean, light and saturating therapy is prescribed.</p>
<p>Su21#20</p>
<p>Food and drinks alleviating V and reducing K and fat, rough, hot and sharp enema, rough annointing,</p>
<p>use of guduci, devadaru, musta, triphala, takrarista (a fermented preparation of butter milk) and honey</p>
<p>...is recommended for removing the over-obesity.</p>
<p>Vidanga, sunthi, yavaksara and ash-powder of black iron mixed with honey ...is an excellent formula for removing the over-obesity.</p>
<p>The powder of barley and amalaka...</p>
<p>...is an excellent formula for removing the over-obesity.</p>
<p>Similarly, Bilvadi pancamula (the 5 big roots) mixed with honey is recommended.</p>
<p>Similarly, the use of silajatu along with the juice of agnimantha is recommended.</p>
<p>In diet,</p>
<p>Prasatika (an inferior cereal), kangu, syamaka, yavaka, yava (barley), jurna, kodrava, green gram, kulattha, makustha, adhaki along with patola and amalaki fruits are to be used.</p>
<p>After meals,</p>
<p>honey water and arista (a fermented preparation) alleviating medas, mamsa and K should be taken as drink.</p>
<p>One desirous of giving up obesity should gradually increase vigils, sexual intercourse, physical exercise and mental work.</p>
<p>Su21#21-28</p>
<p>Sleep, exhilaration, comfortable bed, relaxed mind, calmness; keeping away from mental work, sexual intercourse and physical exercise; cheerfulness, new cereals, fresh</p>
<p>wine, meat-soup of domestic, marshy and aquatic animals, well-cooked meat, curd, ghee, milk, sugar-cane, rice, black gram, wheat, products of jaggery, unctuous and sweet enema, daily oil massage, unctuous anointing, bath, use of fragrance and garlands, white dress, timely drainage of dosas and regular use of bulk-promoting and aphrodisiac formulations remove the over-leanness and provide good development to the person.</p>
<p>One becomes corpulent like a boar by not minding about business, saturating diet and indulgence in sleep.</p>

<p>Before constructing jentaka, one should examine the land:</p>
<p>Land should be in eastern or northern direction, auspicious, spacious, with black and sweet or golden soil.</p>
<p>Here in southern or western bank of a pond, a lake etc. with comfortable stairs and plane level of ground at a distance of 7 or 8 aratni (320cm. or365.76 cm.) from the water, the temporary room should be constructed which should face towards the east or north and be in front of the ghat [stairs leading from the bank into water](of the lake).</p>
<p>The height and area of the house should be 16 aratnis (731.52cm.) and the house should be circular from all sides, well plastered with mud and with many windows.</p>
<p>Inside this room a bench-like extension of one arati (45.72cm.) height and width should be provided all along the wall up to the door. In the center there should be a pillar having charcoal chamber, with many small holes, having a lid, in shape like kandu (a type of oven), made of mud and having diameter of four hasta (1.8m.) and height equal to that of a man. That pillar oven should be filled up with the wood of khadira, aswakarna etc. and be ignited. When the physician is assured that the wood is wellburnt and smokeless and the entire room is heated by that fire and is equipped with fomentable heat, he should admit the patient in, wellmassaged with vatahara oil and well-covered with clothes. While admitting him inside the room, the physician should instruct him like this-O gentle one! Enter the room for well-being and health. After entering you should get on the extension and lie down comfortably on both sides in succession. &quot;You should not get down from the extension [bench] till you expire even if you are sweating too much and fainting. Dropped from this extension and not reaching the door, you will expire due to excessive sweat and fainting. Hence you should never leave this extension. When you feel– you are free from abhisyanda (obstruction in passage due to excess of fluid), sweat and sliminess are discharged well, all passages are free from obstruction, lightness has appeared and constipation, stiffness, numbness, pain and heaviness are gone, then, following the extension you should reach the door and go out.&quot; But immediately afterwards, with a view to protecting the eyes, you should not use cold water. When the heat and exhaustion are over, after a muhurta (about 3/4 hour), you should take ablution with warm water and then take meals.</p>

<p>in persons with intestines having excessive P and strong digestive power, the uncting substance taken is reduced to ashes in a very short time by the power of digestive fire. The fire fanned by unction and being powerful having consumed the dose of the unction, affects the Ojas and gives rise to complicated thirst. Even much heavy food is not able to pacify the fire fueled and intensified with unction. If the person does not get cold water, he is burnt like a serpent lying within a room by his own poison-fire.</p>
<p>If there arises thirst on indigestion of unction, the physician should induce vomiting. Again the patient should drink cold water and rough food and then vomit.</p>
<p>Ghee alone should not be taken in excess of P particularly associated with ama because it produces color (jaundice) in the whole body and having destroyed consciousness kills the patient.</p>

<h1>Benefits of Evacuative Therapy:</h1>
<p>In the person whose belly has been evacuated, the body-fire is stimulated, diseases get pacified, normalcy is maintained;</p>
<p>sense organs, mind, intellect and complexion are improved, strength, nourishment, progeny and potency are produced, the old age does not get his hold easily and the man lives long free from disorders.</p>
<p>Hence one should use the evacuative therapy timely and properly. Su16#17-19</p>
<h1>Significance of Evacuative Therapy as Part of General Treatment:</h1>
<p>Dosas might sometimes aggravate even after treatment with lightening and digestion but they will never recur if they are subdued with evacuative therapy. In case of dosas as well as plants, if the root is not struck at, reappearance of the gone disorders and sprouts (respectively) is certain.</p>
<p>Su16#20-21</p>
<h1>Promoting Therapy to Follow Evacuative Treatment:</h1>
<p>In person reduced by evacuative therapy the body should be promoted with intake of nourishing diet together with ghee, meat soup, milk and relishing vegetable soups, massage, anointing, bath, unctuous and non-unctuous enema.</p>
<p>In this way, he obtains well-being and is endowed with long-life.</p>

<p><em>Here follows a few paragraphs on life-span and the physician&#x27;s role in promoting lifespan.</em></p>
<p><em>It is at the end of this chapter on treatment of complications of Evacuation:</em></p>
<p><strong>The termination of the dhatus [death] is always natural.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is always a cause in production of beings but none in their annihilation though some regard non-initiation of cause as the cause in the latter case.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Su16#27-28</strong></p>
<p><strong>Agnivesha asked Punarnavasu- if there is a termination (of a disorder [disease]) by nature [it will happen automatically in time] then what is the function of a well-equipped physician?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What imbalanced dhatus does he bring to equilibrium by means of therapy? What is the nature of therapeutics and it&#x27;s objective?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Su16#29-30</strong></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="punarnavasu-answered"><strong>Punarnavasu answered:</strong><a href="#punarnavasu-answered" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to punarnavasu-answered" title="Direct link to punarnavasu-answered" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Due to absence of the terminating cause, the cause of annihilation of beings is not observed as in case of eternally moving time due to it&#x27;s fast movement.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The being is terminated as it came into existence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is no causative factor in it&#x27;s annihilation nor is it&#x27;s transformation. Su16#31-33</strong></p>
<p><strong>The measures by which the bodily dhatus are brought back to equilibrium constitute the therapeutics (treatment of disorders).</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is the function of the physician.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The therapy is administered with the objective that there should not be disequilibrium in dhatus and that there should be promotion of dhatus which are in equilibrium.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By abstaining from the factors causing disequilibrium and pursuing those causing equilibrium, the imbalanced ones are produced.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As the well-equipped physician leads to production of balanced dhatus by means of balanced factors, he is regarded as donor of health, happiness and longevity.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The physician, by dint of bestowing health, happiness and longevity, becomes also the donor of virtue, wealth, enjoyment and both the human worlds.</strong></p>

<p>[I believe the following sutras (the next couple pages) have all been entered already to other areas of the book, but I realized that it is important to have one spot (in general P.K. chapter) where the description of the whole P.K. sequence, in Charaka&#x27;s words, was laid down all together. So the following should be kept all together, without headings or added interpretation, etc., so that the student may get a sense of the total process of pancha karma.)] [Do mention that these sutras will be viewed again in more detail in their related chapters, such as purgation and emesis, enema, etc.]</p>
<p>Before formulation the patient should be uncted for a minimum of 3 days and maximum of 7 days. Thereafter unction is not desirable because after one week (7 days) the patient gets suited to it.</p>
<p>Si1#6</p>
<p>Unction destroys V, softens body and removes retention of excrements. Si1#7</p>
<p>Fomentation applied to the uncted person liquefies the impurity hidden in minute channels.</p>
<p>The person to be vomited should be excited (his impurity should be excited) with: the meat soup of domestic, aquatic and marshy animals, black gram as well as milk. [this is K increasing.]</p>
<p>Likewise, the person to be purged should be excited (his doshas/ impurities should be excited) after he is uncted with: meat soup of wild animals and vegetable soup which do not aggravate K. [this is K reducing.]</p>
<p>Si1#8</p>
<p>This is because a person predominant in K vomits easily and the person with little K is purged properly [easily]. If K is deficient, emetic drug goes downwards [becomes purgative instead] and if K is aggravated, the purgative drug goes upwards [becomes emetic].</p>
<p>Si1#9</p>
<p>Emesis as said earlier should be administered to the uncted patient and after vomiting dietetic regimen– liquid gruels etc. should be followed. Likewise, proper purgation should be administered to the patient uncted and fomented properly.</p>
<p>Si1#10</p>
<p>After evacuation, the patient should take liquid gruel, rice paste, processed or unprocessed vegetarian soup and meat in 3, 2 or 1 meal time according to evacuation being of superior [strong], medium and inferior [mild] degree respectively.</p>
<p>Si1#11</p>
<p>As a little camp fire which is kindled gradually and carefully with grasses, cowdung etc. becomes great, stable and all-digesting fire, so also the internal fire (agni) of the evacuated ones does like that with liquid gruel etc.</p>
<p>Si1#12</p>
<p>In emesis, the result is assessed as inferior, medium and superior if the number of impulses is 4, 6 and 8 respectively. In purgation, this number is 10, 20 and 30 and also the quantity of excrement as 2, 3 and 4 prasthas respectively. Emesis should end with expulsion of P and the quantity of the vomit should be half of that of excrement in purgation. Purgation should end with expulsion of K (mucus).</p>
<p>The quantity in purgation should be taken into account after 2 or 3 impulses with feces are passed out and that in emesis after expulsion of the ingested drug.</p>
<p>Si1#13-14</p>
<p>He is regarded as vomited properly whose K, P and V are expelled in this order and when also heart, sides, head, senses and channels are cleansed and lightness is observed.</p>
<p>Si1#15</p>
<p>In ill-vomited, eruptions, urticarial rashes, itching, uncleaning of passage and heaviness in body are observed.</p>
<p>Si1#16</p>
<p>In case of excessive vomiting, there are thirst, mental confusion, fainting, vitiation of V, loss of sleep, strength etc.</p>
<p>In the person purged well, cleansing of channels, clarity of senses, lightness, energy, proper digestive fire, freedom from disorders are observed as well as expulsion of feces, P, K and V in this order.</p>
<p>Si1#17</p>
<p>If he is ill-purged, there are vitiation of K, P and V, depression of digestive fire, heaviness, coryza, drowsiness, vomiting, anorexia and non-carmination of wind.</p>
<p>Si1#18</p>
<p>In case of excessive purgation, disorders due to V caused by diminution of K, rakta and P such as numbness, body-ache, exhaustion, trembling etc., sleeplessness, debility, unconsciousness, insanity and hiccup arise.</p>
<p>Si1#19</p>
<p>The patient having been given diet should be advised to take ghee or unctuosu enema. Then he should be massaged with oil and subjected to non-unctuous enema while not very hungry after 3 days. When it comes out he should be given diet with meat soup of wild animals or according to the severity of dosas.</p>
<p>Thereafter the patient who is fit and has not over-eaten should be given unctuous enema in the night.</p>
<p>Si1#20-21</p>
<p>Non-unctuous enema should be administered during day in winter and spring seasons while during night in autumn, summer and rainy seasons taking precautions against the defects said earlier under intake of uncting substance (Su. 13).</p>
<p>Si1#22</p>
<p>When it comes out, the patient fasted for the night should be given diet in the day and again in the evening. This unctuous enema should be administered to him thereafter on the  $2^{nd}$  or  $3^{rd}$  or  $5^{th}$  day. After non-unctuous enema, unctuous enema should be given on  $2^{nd}$  or  $3^{rd}$  or  $5^{th}$  day.</p>
<p>Si1#23-24</p>
<p>In K disorder 1 to 3, in P disorder 5 to 7 and in V disorders 9 to 11 (in uneven number) (unctuous) enemas should be administered by the expert physician.</p>
<p>Si1#25</p>
<p>The person after purgation should avoid non-unctuous enema necessarily for 7 days. Similarly that evacuated with non-unctuous enema should avoid purgation for the</p>
<p>same period because it inflicts his vacant body.</p>
<p>Si1#26</p>
<p>(Non-unctuous) enema sustains age, provides happy life, strength, digestive fire, intellect, voice and complexion, performs all functions, is free from complications for child, old and adult patients alike, alleviates all disorders, draws out feces, mucus, bile, wind and urine; gives firmness, semen and strength and pacifies all disorders by eliminating accumulation of impurity situated all over the body.</p>
<p>Si1#27-28</p>
<p>When the body is cleansed in the passages by non-unctuous enema, application of unction provides complexion and strength. Nothing is superior to oleation particularly in one suffering from V. Oil destroying roughness, lightness and coldness of V due to unctuousness, heaviness and hotness respectively provides quickly clarity of mind, energy, strength, complexion and corpulence quickly. As a tree irrigated in it&#x27;s root attains blue branches with beautiful tender leaves, flowers and fruits in time and big stature so becomes the man with unctuous enema.</p>
<p>Si1#29-31</p>
<p>[signs of proper, excessive, and insufficient administration of enema are given here..]</p>
<p>After cleansing the body with other evacuative measures in prescribed order one should get the patient uncted and his head fomented with palm (of the hand of an assistant) and then given head evacuation 3 times, twice or once a day considering the 3 fold strength of dosas.</p>
<p>When the patient&#x27;s head is properly evacuated, lightness in chest and head, clarity of senses and cleanness of channels are observed.</p>
<p>If it is deficiently evacuated there are pasting in the throat, heaviness in the head and spitting.</p>
<p>In case of it&#x27;s excessive evacuation, there is distress and pain in head, eyes, temples and ears and the patient sees darkness.</p>
<p>The above case should be managed with mild saturating drop while the case of deficient evacuation should be treated with irritant drugs after unction.</p>
<p>Si1#50-52</p>
<p>This course of treatment is wholesome for the diseased as well as the healthy, promotes strength and life-span and destroys ailments.</p>
<p>Si1#53</p>
<p>Double the period passed in enema should be observed as the period of abstinence (from unwholesome things).</p>
<p>During this period one should avoid excessive sitting , standing and speaking, journey on vehicles, day sleep, coition, suppression of natural urges, cold regimen, exposure to the sun, grief, wrath and taking unwholesome and untimely food.</p>

<p>Hereafter I will tell about the proper method of emesis and purgation and their defects if not properly administered along with treatment. Si6#3</p>
<p>Grisma (summer), varsa (rainy season)_ and hemanta (early winter) are the seasons with severe heat, rains and cold. In between these are 3 moderate seasons namely pravrt (early rains), sarad (autumn) and vasanta (spring).</p>
<p>Si6#4</p>
<p>Pravrt consists of asadha and sravana months, sarad karttika and margasirsa and vasanta phalguna and caitra– this arrangement of seasons is followed for the purpose of evacuation. Thus the physician should administer evacuative remedy considering the seasons as above in case of healthy persons and in diseases according to morbidity.</p>
<p>Si6#5-6</p>
<p>** In between different evacuative measures unction and sudation should be administered ending with unction.</p>
<p>Si6#7</p>
<p>One should administer purgation to those suffering from erysipelas, boils, edema, jaundice, anemia, injury and poisoning after unexcessive unction.</p>
<p>Si6#8</p>
<p>One who is insufficiently uncted should be given unctuous purgation while that having excess of unction should be given rough purgation.</p>
<p>Si6#9</p>
<p>The drug taken in proper dose, after digestion of the previous food, with concentration of mind by the person uncted and sudated exerts proper effect.</p>
<p>Si6#10</p>
<p>As from an unctuous utensil water is removed without any effort, the dosas are detached from the uncted body with the help of drugs. As fire liquidates [[? evaporates?]] the damp wood from all sides, sudation liquidizes the consolidated impurities in the uncted person. AS the dirt of the cloth is washed with water after deterging (with alkali etc.) [* this is the only reference to soap I&#x27;ve found in the entire Charaka!], the impurity of the body is eliminated by evacuative measures after deterging it with unction and sudation.</p>
<p>Si6#11-13</p>
<p>** If the evacuative drug is taken during indigestion, malaise increases, constipation arises and the drug moves reversely. [this is a common occurrence in today&#x27;s clinics.]</p>
<p>Si6#14</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="characters-of-the-drug-administered-in-proper-dose">Characters of the drug administered in proper dose:<a href="#characters-of-the-drug-administered-in-proper-dose" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Characters of the drug administered in proper dose:" title="Direct link to Characters of the drug administered in proper dose:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>it is that which in small dose exerts great force and eliminates plentiful impurity, is easy, light in digestion, good in taste, saturating, alleviates disease, even in faulty application does not harm, does not cause much depression and is endowed with good smell, color and taste.</p>
<p>Si6#15-16</p>
<p>* The drug taken with concentration of mind after waiving off the unwholesome mental emotions such as passion etc. exerts proper effect.</p>
<p>Si6#17</p>
<p>** The person who is to take emesis: the next day should eat K increasing, light in digestion and mostly liquid diet,</p>
<p>while the person who is to take purgation: should take light and hot diet because due to excitement and diminution of K in emesis and purgation respectively, the impurity ooze out quickly.</p>
<p>Si6#18</p>
<p>* When the person has taken the drug, the physician should observe the signs of evacuation.: When in emesis P follows K and in purgation K follows feces and P, the person should be taken as evacuated of the impurity along with the symptoms of: emaciation and debility with lightness [[2 of these last 3 are supposed to be present, temporarily, in this case]].</p>
<p>Si6#19-20</p>
<p>The excess drug should be removed by vomiting but not in absence of lightness. In case of the feeling of wetness and retention of flatus even in absence of eructations, the patient should be vomited till lightness and diluteness of K appear because beyond that it produces untoward effects.</p>
<p>Si6#21</p>
<p>On emesis the digestive fire is stimulated and dosas are pacified. If the signs of proper digestion are not observed the patient should be lightened otherwise should be managed with dietetic regimen such as liquid gruel etc. and not lightening.</p>
<p>Si6#22-23</p>
<p>In a person evacuated with the above 2 evacuative measures (emesis and purgation) the digestive fire gets slowed. Hence one should apply the dietetic regimen with liquid [gruel] etc.</p>
<p>Si6#24</p>
<p>* If k and P are eliminated slightly and the patient is an alcoholic addict and predominant in V and P, one should apply saturating measures instead of liquid gruel etc. because the latter causes obstruction in channels in the alcoholic addicts.</p>
<p>Si6#25</p>
<p>* Carmination of wind, feeling of well-being, hunger and thirst, energy, enthusiasm, lightness, purity of senses and eructation– these are the signs of the drug</p>
<p>digested.</p>
<p>* Exhaustion, burning sensation, malaise, giddiness, fainting, headache, uneasiness and debility– these are the signs of the drug undigested.</p>
<p>Si6#26-27</p>
<p>The drug administered untimely, in lower or higher dose and if it is old, not impregnated (with it&#x27;s own juice or other synergistic drugs) and processed improperly causes untoward effect quickly.</p>
<p>Si6#28</p>
<p>Tympanitis, cutting pain, discharge, tightness in heart, tightness in body, release of vital (blood), failure, other complications and exhaustion– these 10 are the untoward effects which are caused by deficient and excessive application and also due to defects of attendant, drug, physician and patient.</p>
<p>Si6#29-30</p>
<p>Proper application is characterized by: proper elimination of impurity, excessive application by: excessive elimination, and deficient application by: elimination reversely or slightly.</p>
<ul>
<li class="">** If the purgative drug is taken as having: foul smell, exceedingly distasteful, plentiful, during indigestion and by one with excited K, it moves upwards.</li>
<li class="">** If the emetic drug is taken as: sharp, immobile, irritated by one afflicted with hunger, having soft bowels and little excitation of K, it acts as purgative.</li>
<li class="">* Because of eliminating the impurities not fully through the reverse pathway the above conditions are taken as deficient application as the impurity comes out with difficulty or slightly or does not come out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Si6#31-34</p>
<p>If after taking drug the patient is not evacuated, he should repeat the drug [only] after it is digested and not during indigestion [of the drug] because there may be risk of excessive application. In case of deficient effect drug should be administered mild or strong after observing heaviness or lightness of bowels and strength of the patient.</p>
<p>Si6#35-36</p>
<p>** Emetic or purgative drug should not be repeated in patient with tendency of difficult vomiting or purgating respectively because they produce fatal results. Si6#37</p>
<p>* Old drug administered to rough patient who has not been uncted and sudated excites impurities but is unable to expel them and thus produces disorders such as [heart] failure, edema, hiccup, frequent vision of darkness, cramps in calf muscles, itching, malaise in thighs and abnormal complexion.</p>
<p>Si6#38-39</p>
<p>* Old drug administered in too small dose to a patient with stimulated digestive fire and having been uncted and sudated or stilled by excessive cold or in condition of ama excites impurities but does not expel them. These are all cases of deficient application and cause the same disorders as mentioned above. The wise physician after</p>
<p>due consideration should employ the prescribed measures.</p>
<p>* He should be massaged with oil and salt and fomented with bed or bolus methods of fomentation and then the drug should be repeated after the previous intake is digested or non-unctuous enema with cow&#x27;s urine should be given. Thereafter he should be given diet with meat soup of wild animals and birds and then subjected to unctuous enema. He should be uncted with proper dose of oil processed with madanaphala, magadhika and devadaru and other V alleviating uncting substances and then evacuated with drastic drug but not with too drastic because it causes excessive effect.</p>
<p>Si6#40-44</p>
<ul>
<li class="">* Too drastic drug administered to one afflicted with hunger and having soft bowels eliminates feces, bile and mucus quickly and then discharges liquid supporting materials thus causing loss of strength and voice, burning sensation, dryness of throat, giddiness and thirst. In such condition, vomiting should be induced with sweet drug to eliminate the remaining drug. IN vomiting purgation and in purgation vomiting should be induced. It should further be checked by very cold sprinkling, bath etc. astringent, sweet and cold diet and drugs and formulations useful in internal hemorrhage, diarrhea, burning sensation and fever.</li>
<li class="">* Churned drink prepared with anjana, candana, usira, marrow, blood, sarkara, water and powder of parched paddy is an excellent remedy for excessive application of purgation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The patient should be given liquid gruel prepared with leaf-buds of vata etc. mixed with honey and milk and other edibles processed with fecal astringent drugs. Edibles with meat soup of wild animals and slimy enema are commended. He should also be given unctuous enema with ghee extracted from milk and processed with sweet drugs.</p>
<p>Si6#45-51</p>
<p>In excess of vomiting one having been sprinkled over by cold water should take churned drink mixed with ghee, honey and sugar along with fruit juice.</p>
<p>In case of frequent vomiting with eructation and fainting one should administer powder of dhanyaka, musta, madhuka and anjana with honey.</p>
<p>If during vomiting the tongue is retracted inside, use of gargles with unctuous, sour, salty and delicious vegetarian soup, milk and meat soup are wholesome. Besides, other persons should eat sour fruits before him.</p>
<p>If the tongue is protracted it should be put back in position by pasting it with sesamum and dried grapes.</p>
<p>In case of obstruction to speech and wind the wise physician should administer thin gruel processed with ghee and meat and also apply unction and sudation.</p>
<p>Si6#52-56</p>
<p>The patient after emesis and purgation has mild digestive fire and is lightened. Hence to increase digestive fire and vital strength one should follow the dietetic regimen of gruel etc.</p>
<p>Si6#57</p>
<p>Drug in low dose administered to one having plentiful impurity, roughness and depressed digestive fire along with reverse movement of V excites dosas and creates</p>
<p>obstruction to channels and thus causes severe tympanitis in umbilical region, pain in back, sides and head, dyspnea and severe retention of feces, urine and flatus.</p>
<p>In case of tympanitis, massage, sudation, suppository etc., non-unctuous enema and all other measures useful in udavarta [Upward-moving V] are commended.</p>
<p>Si6#58-60</p>
<p>* If a drastic drug is taken by one having unctuousness, heavy bowels and ama dosa or by the other having roughness, soft bowels, tiredness or debility, it expels impurity along with ama shortly on reaching the anorectal region and then causes severe colic, cutting pain and slimy discharge with blood.</p>
<p>In condition of ama lightening, digestive, rough, hot and light food and in that of roughness, bulk-promoting and sweet regimen are commended.</p>
<p>Si6#61-63</p>
<p>* If even after digestion ama continues the formulation of alkali and acid combined should be given in small dose as it is or mixed with floured kasisa or with yavaksara and salt.</p>
<p>In case of aggravation of V, ghee mixed with pomegranate juice should be taken along with diet of soured curd mixed with the rind of pomegranate or he should take paste of devedaru and sesamum seeds with hot water or milk boiled with asvattha, udumbara, plaksa and kadamba. Or he should be given astringent and sweet enema, slimy enema or unctuous enema processed with yastimadhu.</p>
<p>Si6#64-67</p>
<p>Drug administered in low dose to the patient with plentiful impurity excites the impurity and eliminates it slightly and at the same time produces itching, swelling, skin diseases, heaviness, loss of appetite, nausea, feeling of wetness, anorexia and paleness. This condition is known as &quot;parisrava&quot; (continued discharge). In this case, the morbidity should be pacified or the patient should be vomited or after unction he should be again administered a drastic purgative. After evacuation, processed powders, asavas and aristas should be given.</p>
<p>Si6#68-70</p>
<p>If after taking drug one suppresses the urges, then the doshas get vitiated and having reached the cardiac region cause tightness in the heart. Because of this the patient suffers from hiccup, cough, pain in sides, anxious expression, salivation and rolling of eyeballs; bites his tongue and becomes unconscious while washing his teeth.</p>
<p>* Here the physician should not get confused and should administer emesis immediately with sweet drugs if the patient suffers from P fainting and with pungent ones if he suffers from K type fainting [[perhaps the description of the types of epilepsy, in the chapter on epilepsy, gives also the correct description of dosic types of fainting. Narcosis is also described in the chapter on blood.]]. Then his remaining impurity should be digested with digestive and his digestive fire and strength should be raised gradually.</p>
<p>If during excessive vomiting the patient develops pain in the heart due to V he should be given unctuous, sour and salty regimens and if it is due to P and K, other appropriate regimens should be adopted.</p>
<p>Si6#71-75</p>
<p>If after taking drug V gets obstructed due to suppression of urges or K it seizes</p>
<p>the body parts after evacuation with stiffness, tremors, pricking pain, malaise, cramps and churning pain. In this condition, all V-alleviating measures such as unction, sudation, etc. should be applied.</p>
<p>Si6#76-77</p>
<p>** If a very drastic drug is administered to a patient with soft bowels and little impurity, after eliminating the impurities it takes away vital blood by churning. For test, 1) one should give it mixed with food to a crow or a dog. If it is eaten it is vital blood otherwise it is P (raktapitta). 2) White cloth piece impregnated with it and dried should be washed with warm water. If the color only fades it is P and if it is completely wiped off it is vital blood.</p>
<p>In patient afflicted with thirst, fainting and narcosis one should continue the treatment with P-alleviating measures and those beneficial in excessive application till he survives. * The patient should take fresh [[raw]] blood of living animals like deer, cow, buffalo and goat which revives and unites immediately with vital principle. The same blood mixed with extract of darbha should be given as enema. Milk cooled after boiling with syama, kasmarya, badari, durva and mixed with ghee-scum and anjana should be given as enema. Or he should be given very cold slimy enema or unctuous enema with ghee scum.</p>
<p>Si6#78-84</p>
<p>* Prolapsed rectum should be put back in position by stiffening it with astringent applications.</p>
<p>In case of unconsciousness one should advise to use consolation and musical sounds.</p>
<p>When purgative taken stays upto feces or emetic up to the drug, the dosas are excited but not expelled and thus the aggravated dosas produce disorders like itching etc. This is known as &quot;vibhramsa&quot; (failure). Its remedy is according to the disease.</p>
<p>Si6#85-87</p>
<p>If unctuous drug is taken by an uncted patient [[patient who has been uncted on the day of purgation, rather than stopping unction 1 or 2 days prior]], it is obstructed by impurities due to mildness and as such does not eliminate them but rather checks them when they are dislodged from their sites. Further it expels them slightly with retention of flatus, stiffening and pain in ano-rectum. In such case, the patient requires lightening, digestion and thereafter sharp enema and purgation.</p>
<p>Si6#88-89</p>
<p>If a rough or weak patient takes rough purgative drug, it instantly vitiates V and thus causes severe complications such as severe stiffness and pain all over the body and fainting. In such condition, V-alleviating measures such as unction, sudation etc. should be applied.</p>
<p>Si6#90-91</p>
<p>Mild drug given to the patient who is uncted and has soft bowels excites K and thereby obstructs P and V and causes drowsiness, heaviness, exhaustion, debility and malaise. In this condition, the drug should be vomited [and] immediately thereafter lightening, digestion and then sharp and unctuous evacuation drug is administered.</p>

<p>Now the summing up verses–</p>
<p>Thus the above complications with signs and management of emesis and purgation if administered by inefficient physicians are said. The wise physician knowing these and other conditions as they are should administer the evacuative measures properly in order to promote health of the people.</p>

<p>When the body is cleansed in passages by non-unctuous enema, application of unction provides complexion and strength. Nothing is superior to oleation particularly in one suffering from V. Oil destroying roughness, lightness and coldness of V due to unctuousness, heaviness and hotness respectively provides quickly clarity of mind, energy, strength, complexion and corpulence quickly. As a tree irrigated in its roots attains blue branches with beautiful tender leaves, flowers and fruits in time and big stature so becomes the man with unctuous enema.</p>

<p>Enema is commended particularly for those who are stiffened, contracted, lame, afflicted with dislocation and in whose extremities aggravated V is moving. - Si1#32</p>
<p>Enema is prescribed in tympanitis, knotted feces, colic pain, non-liking for food ad other such disorders of G.I. tract. -Si1#33</p>
<p>Enema is highly beneficial for the women who do not conceive on copulation with men due to complication caused by V [and so probably for other uterine problems, i.e. amenorrhea, etc.] and for men who have deteriorated sense and are debilitated. -Si1#34</p>

<p>One should not use either unctuous or non-unctuous enema exclusively because there is risk of nausea and loss of digestive fire due to the former and of aggravation of V due to the latter.

<p>Matrabasti is always applicable to those emaciated due to overwork, physical exercise, weight-lifting, wayfaring, journey on vehicles and indulgence in women, debilitated and broken by V. Matrabasti equal to the lowest dose of unctuous enema [[1C?? 60cc?? 80cc? 25cc? -No!

<p>-the above chartSi8#15-33</p>
<p>&quot;Thus variations of the combinations of 3, 4 and 5 factors may also be defined. <strong>This method said in the context of DIARRHOEA may well be applied in all diseases.</strong> -Si8#34</p>
<p>[[so, all the above chart has been about treatment of diarrhoea, but will also apply to all other diseases]].</p>
<p>If all the 6 factors are combined together the digestive potion containing all the 6 rasas should be prescribed. -Si8#35</p>
<p>In combination of the five ones except ama, enema of the drugs with all the 6 rasas is commended. -Si8#35</p>
<p>[the information below follows, but probably should be left out of book I ]. &quot;Ghee 640gm. Should be cooked with the double quantity of milk and the paste of unripe fruits of udumbara, bark of jambu, amra, and udumbara, conch, sarjarasa, lac and mud each 40gm.. This should be taken in all types of diarrhea according to strength. - Si8#36,37</p>
<p>Gruel prepared with kacchura, dhataki, bilva, lajjalu, red sali rice, lentils and leaf buds of asvattha boiled in water is useful. -Si8#38</p>
<p>Likewise gruel may be prepared with vata, udumbara, aralu, lajjalu an tender leaves of plaksa as well as lentils, dhataki flowers and bala. -Si8#39 Gruels may also be prepared with lentils in decoctions of drugs of laghu pancamula, vatadi and iksvadi groups separately. Si8#40</p>
<p>Gruels prepared with kacchura root, grains of sali rice etc. in curd, buttermilk, sour gruel, milk or sugarcane juice cooled and added with sugar and honey as well as with ghee, marica and cumin seeds tasted as sweet and salty are wholesome and alleviate all type of diarrhea. &quot; -Si8#41,42</p>
<p>[even though the above info came in a chapter on enemas, it comes at the end of some info on treatment of diarrhoea. These formulas do not specify if to take orally or rectally, but &quot;gruel&quot; probably indicates oral intake, but the lack of specification also probably indicates that it may, as necessary, also be used in other forms, i.e. rectally.]</p>
<p>[now back to the enema info:]</p>
<p>&quot;In V, the potion should be of unctuous, sour, salty and sweet drugs and enema as tepid. In P as well as rakta, the potion should be of cold, bitter, astringent and sweet drugs. In K it should be of bitter, hot, astringent and pungent drugs. In feces, it should be astringent and V-alleviating. In ama, it should be digestive while in blood enema with slimy drugs and blood are recommended.&quot; -Si8#43-44</p>
<p>&quot;Thus treatment of diarrhea simply and jointly as in care of duals etc. has been said. This should be adopted in disorders according to predominance of particular factors.&quot; -Si8#45</p>

<p>O Agnivesha! now listen about the successful application of enemas commended in respective diseases which gives success to physicians: -Si10#3</p>
<p>If applied properly with due consideration of strength, impurity, time, disease and constitution and prepared with respective drugs, they alleviate the concerned disorders. - Si10#4</p>
<p>There is no therapy equal to enema because it evacuates quickly and easily, saturates or desaturates shortly and is free from untoward effects. -Si10#5</p>
<p>In spite of being eliminator of impurity, purgation has demerits of uneasiness, belching, nausea, unpleasantness and griping due to ingestion of drugs as pungent, sharp, hot etc. Moreover, the children and the old persons are unfit for purgation because they have not gained sufficient strength of dhatus and have their strength diminished respectively. IN these cases non-unctuous enema alone is the best therapy which serves all the purposes. It quickly provides strength, complexion, exhilaration, softness and unction in body of the persons.</p>
<p>-Si10#6,7</p>
<p>Enema is of 3 types- unctuous, non-unctuous and urethral (or vaginal). It is commended for those suffering from V in the extremities such as contracture, ankylosis, dislocation and pain and in retention of feces, tympanitits, anorexia, cutting pain etc. One should apply enemas after due consideration, cold ones for those suffering from heat and tepid ones for those suffering from cold and added with suitable drugs.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="si108-10">Si10#8-10<a href="#si108-10" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Si10#8-10" title="Direct link to Si10#8-10" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>In diseases requiring evacuation no promoting enemas should be given. The obese and those suffering from kustha and prameha require evacuation. On the contrary, the evacuative enemas should not be applied to those who are wasted, wounded, debilitated, fainted emaciated and dried and others who&#x27;s life is bound with impurity.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="si1011-12">Si10#11-12<a href="#si1011-12" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Si10#11-12" title="Direct link to Si10#11-12" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>For aphrodisiac effect and in rakta and P enemas should be added with honey, ghee and milk while in K and V these should be added with oil, urine, sour gruel and salt.</p>
<p>In enemas, sour liquid, urine, milk, wine and decoctions should be used along with hot water because of non-antagonism with dhatus and being primordial source of rasa. -Si10#13-14</p>
<p>Devadaru, ela, kustha, madhuka, pippali, madhu, uncting substances, emetics, purgatives, mustard, sugar and salt- these are to be added in enemas.</p>

<p>&quot;Jimutaka is alleviator of K and P and is the best one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Jimutaka does not break the fecal mass because of mildness. Hence katutumba is the best one as emetic and also eliminates impurity by enema.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;katutumba is unsuitable due to hotness, sharpness, pungency and roughness. Dhamargava is the best alleviator of K and P.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, Dhamargava is V-aggravating, depressant and debilitating. Kutaja is the best one which alleviates K and P but does not affect strength.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kutaja is exceedingly absorbent of fluid, emetic and excites V. Krtavedhana is the best one because it alleviates severe K and P and does not aggravate V.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Krtavedhana is too pungent and debilitating.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus after listening to the arguments, son of Atri said- &quot;there is nothing which is devoid of demerits and merits, so only predominance of merits will be considered. So jimutaka is useful in kustha, iksvaku in prameha, fruit of kutaja in heart disease, dhamargava in anemia, krtavedhana in udararoga, while madana is universally applicable.

<p>The enema, performing all the merits and performing all functions, does not go up beyond umbilical region and moves only below it up to the anus. So how does it eliminate impurities from the whole body?</p>
<p>The body is controlled by V through removing the retention and it alone or in combination of other dosas gets vitiated in it&#x27;s own location. Enema, by way of evacuation, carminates V with P, K and feces. Thus by pacification of V, the diseases situated in the entire body get pacified. -Si11#17-18</p>

<p><strong>Thereafter the patient should be given diet with meat soup of wild animals and then unctuous enema with danti oil should be administered to him.</strong></p>

<p><strong>This enema is also useful for ever-ill persons and promotes strength and complexion:</strong></p>

<p><strong>In case of children, decoction of vitalizer drugs and jyotismati should be used in unctuous and non-unctuous enema especially.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;These rasayana uncting enemas should be prepared after cooking 100 or 1000 times, if funds permit, for increasing the strength of potency.&quot; -Si12#19</p>
<p>&quot;Thus these enemas and uncting preparations known as &quot;yapana&quot; (sustaining) are said which are non-antagonistic to healthy, diseased and old persons, promote semen,</p>
<p>muscles and strength to those indulged in sexual intercourse, pacify all diseases, applicable in all seasons, provide fertility to women and serve the purpose of both the unctuous and non-unctuous enema.&quot;</p>
<p>Si12#20-22</p>
<p>During the application of these enemas one should avoid physical exertions, coitus, wine, honey, cold water, over-eating and vehicular jerking.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="si1223">Si12#23<a href="#si1223" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Si12#23" title="Direct link to Si12#23" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>**&quot;Similar to those in cock, there are 3 enemas with testicles of peacock, Indian crane and swan, 20 with gallinaceous birds, 30 with pecking ones, 29 with snatching ones, 27 with those moving on water, 9 with fish etc. like preparations with peacock, 10 with crab etc. like those with tortoise, 17 with antelopes, 19 with gallinaceous birds, 9 with marshy animals like those with cock and peacock, 14 with burrow-dwelling ones and 29 with uncting substances. Thus mentioned in detail they are 216. These enemas added with honey make the man superbly potent and being retained they do not cause symptoms of excessive or deficient applications.&quot;</p>
<p>Si12#24-28</p>
<p>If these enemas when applied do not return due to mildness, drastic non-unctuous enema with urine should be administered immediately.</p>

<p>Due to excessive application of sustaining enema swelling, loss of digestive fire, paleness, colic, piles, cutting pain, fever and diarrhea arise. -Si12#30</p>
<p>In such case the digestive fire should be stimulated by administering arista, alkali, sidhu etc..</p>
<p>Hence one should use the sustaining enema properly and not with indulgence.</p>
<p>Thus the complications such as loud speaking etc. along with treatment are describe in detail [earlier]. The patient should always be protected from them.</p>

<p>The drugs which are mostly used in non-unctuous enema in different conditions of patients may become innumerable because of being too many if they are described in detail by individual names, but as the dealing of the subject in the treatise is desired in not too brief and not too exhaustive form, and only the knowledge is desired, they are mentioned here only according to the 6 tastes. In respect of these, the details of the variations in combination of tastes are immeasurable because of the excessive numerousness of the proportional variations in combined tastes. Hence for illustration, a part of the drugs having grouped by the 6 tastes, 6 groups of drugs used in non-unctuous enema are mentioned here according to tastes for characterization according to name on the basis of individual tastes. -Vi8#137</p>
<p>[shorten up the above paragraph]</p>
<p>That non-unctuous enema is of 6 types having single rasa (taste) as said by physicians is, in fact, very rare because the drugs possess mostly the combined tastes. Hence the drugs included in the madhura (sweet) group mean those which are sweet, predominantly sweet, sweet in vipaka or have effects of sweet drugs. This is also in case of the drugs in the other taste categories.</p>

<p>for Evacuative: powder should be prepared from the drugs mentioned as head-evacuative in &quot;parts of fruits etc.&quot; (Vi. 8).</p>
<p>for Unctuous Evacuative: prepare the same drugs above, with uncting</p>
<p>substance.</p>
<p>for Uncting Saturating : should be prepared with the drugs mentioned in the &quot;sweet&quot; group and used accordingly.</p>
<h1>Procedure for Administration of [Saturating Unction only] Nasal Therapy:</h1>
<p>Administer the saturating unction into the nostrils of the one having finished the daily routine duties and lying in supine position comfortably on a cot wellcovered with slightly lowered head and raised feet. If the head is not lowered the nasal drug does not reach the head and if the head is lowered too much, the nasal drug gets stationed excessively in the brain.</p>
<p>Hence one should foment the head of the person lying in such position for proper evacuation. After fomenting, the nose should be raised up with the joint of the left thumb and with the right hand one should administer the nasal unction methodically through tube or tampon equally in both nostrils. Thereafter it should be fomented and the uncting substance with mucous should be drawn out frequently so that it does not stay.</p>
<p>K manifested during nasal therapy and excited by fomentation further sticks in the head due to coldness of unction and thus gives rise to disorders in ear, carotid regions and throat etc. Hence one should smoke after the nasal therapy which may alleviate K.</p>
<p>Moreover, he should take wholesome diet, live in wind-free place, use hot things and keep control on his senses.</p>

<p>By (using) this the great sages like Cyavana etc. regained youthful age and became charming for the women, they also attained firm, even and well-divided muscles; compact and stable physique; blossomed strength, complexion and senses; uninterrupted prowess and endurance.</p>
<p>All morbidities arise due to domestic food in those eating sour, saline, pungent alkaline, dried vegetables, meat, sesamum, sesamum paste and preparations or (rice) flour; germinated or fresh, awned or leguminous cereals, antagonistic, unsuitable, rough, alkaline and channel-blocking substances; decomposed, heavy, putrefied and stale food items, indulging in irregular diet or eating while the previous food is undigested; daysleep, women and wine; performing irregular and excessive physical exercise causing agitation in the body; affected with fear, anger, grief, greed, confusion and exhaustion.</p>
<p>Because of this muscles get relaxed, joints get loosened, blood gets burnt, fat becomes abundant and liquefied, marrow does not mature in bones, semen does not manifest and ojas deteriorates.</p>
<p>Thus the person subdued with malaise, depression, sleep, drowsiness, lassitude, lack of enthusiasm, dyspnea, incapability in physical and mental activities, loss of memory, intellect and lustre, becomes resort of illness and thus does not enjoy the normal life-span.</p>
<p>Hence, looking to these defects, one should abstain from all the said unwholesome diet and activities so that he becomes fit for using the rasayana treatment.</p>

<p>Bhallataka-ksira:</p>
<p>By this one attains stable life-span of 100 years without senility. Other attainments are as said earlier.</p>
<p>Directions for making Bhalataka-ksira:</p>
<p>The fruits of bhallataka– undamaged, undiseased, mature in taste, size and potency; looking like ripe jamboo fruits– should be collected in the month of Jyestha or Asadha (late summer) and be stored within the granary of barley or black gram.</p>
<p>After 4 months in the month of Agrahayana or Pausa (early winter) they should be taken out for use.</p>
<p>The fruits should be crushed and then boiled in 10 times water, until 1/8 volume of extract remains. This should be filtered.</p>
<p>Note: Each day&#x27;s supply of fruits should be crushed and extracted one day at a time, as needed.</p>
<p>The candidate for this rasayana should have made his body fit through intake of cold, unctuous and sweet substances.</p>
<p>The bhallataka extract should be taken mixed with milk after smearing the inner part of the mouth with ghee.</p>
<p>The extract for the 1st day should be made from 10 fruits.</p>
<p>Gradually increasing the dose by 1 fruit per day it should be led to 30 which is the maximum dose.</p>
<p>In this way, the total number of fruits taken comes to 1000.</p>
<p>When the drug is digested, one should take sali or sastika rice with milk added with ghee.</p>
<p>After the treatment is over, the patient should live on milk diet for the period double to that of treatment.</p>

<p>Silajatu Rasayana:</p>
<p>Silajatu originates from 4 metals: gold, silver, copper and black iron.</p>
<p>It is slightly sour, astringent in taste, katu in vipaka and is moderate (neither too cold nor too hot) in virya.</p>
<p>This is rasayana in effect and if applied methodically it is aphrodisiac and alleviates diseases.</p>
<p>Its potency enhances if it is impregnated with decoctions of drugs alleviating V, P and K either singly or collectively.</p>
<p>Ci1.3#48-50</p>
<p>The impregnation is performed by dipping it in lukewarm decoction and then taking it out at the end of the day, and repeating this process for a week.</p>
<p>Silajatu mixed with powdered metals should be taken with milk by aforesaid method.</p>
<p>This formulation provides happy long life, alleviates old age ad diseases, stabilizes the body, promotes intellect and memory and excellence of taken with milk diet.</p>
<p>The use of this rasayana is threefold, according to effect:</p>
<p>7 weeks superior 3 weeks medium</p>
<p>1 week inferior</p>
<p>The dose is also threefold, according to effect:</p>
<p>40gm. Superior 20gm. Medium 10gm. Inferior</p>
<p>Ci1.3#51-54</p>
<p>Source of Silajatu:</p>
<p>The mountainous ores of gold etc. when heated by the sun excrete a material like lac, soft, smooth and clear. This is known as silajatu.</p>
<p>Differentiation of Silajatu Derived from Different Metals:</p>
<p>Gold:</p>
<p>Silajatu obtained from gold ore is sweet, slightly bitter, having color like japa flower, pungent in vipaka and sita virya. It is useful in V-P disorders.</p>
<p>Silver:</p>
<p>That obtained from silver ore is pungent, white, cold and madhura in vipaka.. It is useful in K-P disorders.</p>
<p>Copper:</p>
<p>That obtained from copper ore is like peacock&#x27;s neck, bitter, hot and Katuvipaka. It is useful in K disorders.</p>
<p>Iron:</p>
<p>That obtained from iron ore is like gugguluka, bitter, slightly saline, katuvipak and cold. It is the best of all. It is useful in tridoshic disorders.</p>
<p>Ci1.3#55-61</p>
<p>All types of silajatu smell like cow&#x27;s urine and are applicable in all conditions. However, in the use of rasayana, the last one is preferred.</p>
<p>Ci1.3#60-61</p>
<p>During administration of silajatu, one should avoid vidahi (causing burning and hyperacidity) and heavy substances particularly horse gram. Horse gram, due to exceedingly contradictory nature, breaks the stones as seen in practice, that is why its use is contra-indicated.</p>
<p>Milk, buttermilk, meatsoup, vegetable soups, water, urine and various decoctions</p>
<p>are used for dissolving silajatu according to the object.</p>
<p>There is no disease in the world which is not overcome by silajatu. It provides great energy to the healthy person if used methodically and timely. Ci1.3#62-65</p>

<p>The sages, hermits as well as mendicants ([beggar-monk]), at certain periods, due to intake of domestic drugs and diet mostly became heavily corpulent, with movements slowed down and unhealthy.</p>
<p>Being unable to perform their routine duties, they considered their own fault caused by domestic living and thus shifted to their previous abode, Himalayas, which is free from domestic defects, propitious, pious, noble, favorable for intellect, unapproachable for the unholy, the source of origin of Ganga, frequented by the gods, gandharvas and kinnaras, the storehouse of many precious stones, having incomprehensible miraculous powers, resided by intellectual sages, accomplished persons and wanderers, the source of celestial centres and plants, the great savior and protected by the Lord of gods.</p>
<p>This group of great sages consisted of Bhrgu, Angiras, Atri, Vasistha, Kasyapa,</p>
<p>Agastya, Pulastya, Vamadeva, Asita, Gautama etc.</p>
<p>Indra, the preceptor of gods and having 1000 eyes, said to them-</p>
<p>&#x27;Welcome to the intellectual sages, knowers of Brahman, possessing wealth of knowledge and penance.</p>
<p>You are having malaise, lustrelessness, derangement of voice and complexion and ill-health along with it&#x27;s associated corollaries caused by domestic living.</p>
<p>Domestic living is the root of all the inauspicous.</p>
<p>You have done great favor to the people, now it is time for the intellectual sages to look to their own body (health) and to deliver instructions in the science of life for the well-being of your own as well as of the people.&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Ayurveda is delivered to me by Aswin who received it from Prajapati, who again was imparted with the same by Brahma.</p>
<p>Now looking to the short life of the people and that also afflicted with senility and diseases associated with unhappiness and continuous troubles causing disturbance in performance of penance, restraint, regular practices, clarity and study you should learn from me, understand propagate the sagely knowledge (of Ayurveda) which is the holiest, prolonging life-span, alleviating senility and diseases, producing energy, the nectar-like, propitious savior and for the welfare of the people with friendliness and compassion to them and to earn for yourselves the best, holy, noble and immortal intellectual duty.&#x27;</p>
<p>After hearing the words of the king of gods, all the sages praised the superior of gods with incantations and applauded his statement with great pleasure.</p>
<p>Indra, having infused the nectar of Ayurveda to the sages said–</p>
<p>&#x27;Now all this has to be implemented.</p>
<p>This is the auspicious time for rasayanas and the celestial drugs grown in Himalayas are also matured such as- aindri, brahmi, payasya, ksirapuspa, sravani, mahasravani, satavari, vidari, jivanti, punarnava, nagabala, sthira, vaca, chatra, atichatra, meda, mahameda and other vitality-promoting drugs if taken with milk for 6 months provide certainly the maximum life-span, youthful age, diseaselessness, excellence of voice and complexion, corpulence, intellect, memory, superior strength and other desired merits.&#x27;</p>

<p>In 6 months he becomes similar to gods in age, complexion, voice, face, strength and lustre; all the knowledge appears intuitively, he attains divine vision and audition, movement up to 1000 yojanas (8000 miles) and unafflicted life-span of 1000 years.</p>

<p>The effect of the divine herbs can be tolerated only by the persons like you and not by those with uncontrolled self.

These herbs growing in holy lands can be used by forest-dwellers as well as householders with proper carefulness and self-control. - Ci1.4#8-10</p>
<p>These herbs exert milder effect in case of different habitat, subject and mode of administration though the method of intake is the same for all.</p>

<p>The other Rasayana said by Indra:</p>
<p>This rasayana alleviates all diseases, is aphrodisiac, excellent life-promoting, provides strength to psyche, memory, physique, agni, intellect and senses; promotes energy, complexion and voice; alleviates poisons and inauspiciousness and renders the words truthful. This intellect-promoting and broad-spectrum rasayana should be used properly by those who desire success, youthful age, charming personality and universal fame:</p>
<p>&quot;10 drugs of strength-promoting, vitality-promoting, bulk-promoting and agesustaining groups, khadira, bijaka, kharjura, madhuka, musta, utpala, mrdwika, vidanga, vaca, citraka, satavari, payasya, pippali, aguru, rddhi, nagabala, saka, dhava, triphala, kantakari, vidari, candana, iksu, roots of sara, gambhari and tinisa– juice of all these drugs and alkali of palasa should be taken in the quantity of 40gm. each&quot;</p>

<p>Thereafter the dose according to digestion should be used mixing it with the powder (bhasma) of gold, copper, coral, iron, quartz, pearl, cat&#x27;s eye, conch and silver in 1/6 quantity [each].</p>
<p>During the period of medication the patient should avoid exertion and sexual intercourse and take diet of sastika rice along with ghee after the previous meal is digested.</p>

<p>is advised for those who are capable, disease-free, wise, self-controlled, leisurely and rich. Otherwise, the outdoor method is advisable.</p>
<p>The former one is, no doubt, better but is very difficult.</p>
<p>IF during the period some complications arise due to faulty method, proper respective treatment should be provided and the rasayana course should be stopped.</p>
<p>Ci1.4#27-29</p>
<p>The person who is truthful, free from anger, abstaining from wine and women, nonviolent, non-exerting, calm, sweet-spoken, engaged in japa (repeating incantations) and cleanliness, perseverant, observing charity, penance; worshipping gods, cow, brahmanas, teacher, preceptor and elders, devoted to love and compassion, observing vigil and sleep in balance, using regularly ghee extracted from milk, knowing the measure of place and time with propriety, unconceited, well-behaved, simple, having senses concentrated to spiritualism, keeping company of elders, positivist, self-controlled and devoted to holy scriptures should be regarded as using the rasayana for ever. That who, endowed with all these qualities, uses rasayana, attains all the aforesaid fruits of the same.</p>
<p>(Thus Behaviourial Rasayana).</p>
<p>Ci1.4#30-35</p>
<p>One can never attain the fruits of rasayana if he is not undergone grossly the process of elimination of his physical as well as mental impurities.</p>
<p>The formulations meant for providing longevity and alleviating senility and diseases succeed (only) in patients having purified mind and body and controlled self.</p>
<p>All this should not be delivered to those who have degenerate self, &quot;are diseasefree&quot;, are not twice-born and are uninterested.</p>

<p>The rasayana formulations, aphrodisiac recipes and remedial measures for the diseases– all depend on a proper physician.</p>
<p>Hence the wise should honor with all means the physician who promotes life, is wise and well-versed in the science of life as the king of gods honors Aswins.</p>
<p>Aswins are regarded as physicians of gods and carriers of sacrifices. (They have shown many miracles such as) the head of the sacrifice was cut which was joined by them. The fallen teeth of Pusan, destroyed eyes of Bhaga and the spastic arms of Vajrin (Indra) were treated by them and thus he, addicted to soma drink, was again made happy. Cyavana, the descendent of Bhrgu, who was sensually indulged and became diseased, devoid of complexion and voice in old age, was reverted to youthful age. On account of these and other similar achievements, the 2 excellent physicians became highly adorable to the great selves like Indra etc. and vessels, praises, recitations, various food preparations, incences and animals are offered to them by the twice-born. In the morning, Indra enjoys the soma drink in company of Aswins and he also makes pleasure along with them in the Sautramani sacrifice. Indra, Agni, and Aswins are worshipped mostly by the twice-born and area praised in vedic hymns, not so the other gods. Thus the twin physicians, Aswins, are worshipped carefully by the gods and their masters. Then how should the physicians not be honored with all means by mortals who are afflicted with death, disease and senility and are after the search of happiness? The physician who is endowed with good conduct, wisdom and rationality, is thrice-born, well-versed in scriptures and master of (the science of) life should be honored as preceptor by the people.</p>
<p>Ci1.4#39-51</p>
<p>After completing training, it is the 3rd birth of the physician because the physician does not carry the epithet &#x27;Vaidya&#x27; from the previous birth.</p>
<p>[a person will not be called &#x27;vaidya&#x27; from birth. It is a title that is earned upon acquisition of sufficient skill.]</p>
<p>On completion of training, Brahma (pertaining to Brahma) or Arsa (pertaining to sages) psyche enters into him certainly according to the (type of) knowledge.</p>
<p>Hence the physician is known as the thrice-born.</p>
<p>The wise, desirous of stable life, should not backbite, reproach and harm the master of life.</p>
<p>Ci1.4#52-54</p>
<p>The treated patient, whether having promised or not, if does not offer any thing to the physician he is not freed (from the debt).</p>
<p>(On the other hand) the physician too should consider all his patients as his own sons, protect them sincerely from all the troubles, wishing the excellent piety.</p>
<p>Ayurveda has been enlightened by the great sages devoted to piety and wishing immortal positions for welfare (of the people) and not for earning or enjoyment.</p>
<p>That who takes up the treatment only for human welfare and not for earning or enjoying exceeds all and those who sell the regimens of therapy for livelihood are devoted to the heap of dust leaving aside the store of gold.</p>
<p>That who provides life to those being dragged to the abode of death by severe diseases while cutting the death-nets can not be simulated with any other donor of virtue and wealth because there is no charity better than providing life.</p>
<p>The physician who, considering compassion on beings as the highest virtue, proceeds in treatment of patients, accomplishes all objects and enjoys maximum happiness.</p>

<p>A conscious person should use aphrodisiacs regularly because virtue, wealth, pleasure and fame depend on it.</p>
<p>[This is because Ayurvedic aphrodisiacs not only increase procreative virility, but also increase the strength of the dhatus, and strong dhatus lead directly to the above merits. (See &#x27;Strength of Dhatus&#x27; section in Book I).]</p>
<p>&#x27;It also gives rise to male offspring which is the resort of all qualities.&#x27;</p>
<p>[Interpretation: &#x27;all good comes from having male offspring.&#x27;]</p>
<p>Ci2.1#3</p>
<h1>Aphrodisiac Effect of a Woman:</h1>
<p>The foremost aphrodisiac is the repository which is the exhilarating woman.</p>
<p>The favorite sense objects even singly are exceedingly pleasant what to be said of the female physique where they are stationed collectively (the multitude of the sense objects is only in the female body not anywhere else).</p>
<p>[Re-write the above statement.]</p>
<p>Moreover, the sense object located in woman is more pleasure-giving because there is special pleasure in women and the progeny too is dependant on woman.</p>

<p>Not all persons having strength get progeny.</p>
<p>Even a man with a big body and plenty of strength may still be &#x27;weak in women&#x27;.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are persons with small stature, who are constitutionally weak and debilitated by diseases but who are very potent for women and get numerous offsprings.</p>
<p>Some persons traffick into women frequently like sparrows,</p>
<p>While others can not do so and discharge semen profusely like an elephant.</p>

<p>Hence, I will describe the formulations which provide strength to the weak, promote further strength in the strong, and are easy in administration.</p>
<p>Ci2.4#8</p>
<p>The physician, considering the strength, should administer the formulations for promoting semen and virility <strong>after cleansing the body by non-unctuous and unctuous enema.</strong></p>
<p><strong>These enemas should be prepared with ghee, oil, meat-soup, milk, sugar and honey while the patient is kept on the diet of milk or meat-soup.</strong></p>
<p><strong>#9-10</strong></p>
<p><strong>[***It is valuable to observe that the &#x27;cleansing measures&#x27; here recommended are only the 2 enemas; no rough purgations. Further, the enemas are made of nourishing substances. And yet, Punarvasu assures that they are cleansing. And note that the patient has been put on a liquid diet for this period (milk or meat soup). Also, it may be that lightening drugs may be added to the enemas, such as madana, wines, pungents, haritake, etc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So, perhaps this Anuvasana-Brmhana Basti Set should be the standard for &#x27;cleansing&#x27; for the weak. Clinically, it looks right!***]</strong></p>

<p>General Information About Aphrodisiacs:</p>
<p>Whatever is sweet, unctuous, vitalizer, bulk-promoting, heavy and exhilarating is aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>Hence one should have intercourse after having been replenished with such aphrodisiac drugs, and only when one is impelled by his own sex urge and has been exhilarated by the qualities of women.</p>
<p>After sexual intercourse one should take a bath and then go to sleep after taking milk or meat-soup.</p>
<p>In this way his semen and strength are replenished.</p>

<p>As fragrance is not manifested in a flower-bud but the same is found after it blossoms, similarly is the semen.</p>
<p>The man who wants full life-span should not have intercourse before the age of 16 or after the age of 70.</p>

<p>Listen to how the man having undamaged sperm and the woman having undamaged ovum and uterus may conceive excellent progeny.</p>
<p>Sa8#3</p>
<p>First of all both man and woman should undergo unction and fomentation and thereafter purify themselves by emesis and purgation so that they come gradually to normalcy.</p>
<p>Thereafter they should apply non-unctuous and unctuous enema.</p>
<p>Then the man should be managed with ghee and milk cooked with sweet drugs and the woman with oil and black gram.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="correct-manner-of-intercourse-for-conception">[Correct Manner of Intercourse for Conception:]<a href="#correct-manner-of-intercourse-for-conception" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to [Correct Manner of Intercourse for Conception:]" title="Direct link to [Correct Manner of Intercourse for Conception:]" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Sa8#4</p>
<p>After the onset of menstruation, for 3 days and nights, the woman should observe celibacy, should sleep on the ground, take food with hands from and unbroken utensil and should not cleanse her body in any way.</p>
<p>On the 4th day, she should be anointed and bathed from head and provided with white apparel alongwith the man.</p>
<p>Now both the partners wearing white apparel and garland, with pleasant disposition and loving each other should enter into sexual intercourse on even day after bath if they desire a male child or on odd days if they desire a female child.</p>
<p>Sa8#5</p>
<p>One should not perform coitus with the female partner in her bending down or side position. In the former, V being strong inflicts the genital track and in the latter, if she is on her right side, K coming down blocks the uterus or if on her left side P situated there afflicts both ovum and sperm with burning.</p>
<p>Hence she should receive the seed (semen) while in supine position because in that condition doshas remain in their normal position.</p>
<p>After the act is completed, she should be sprinkled with cold water.</p>
<p>The woman subjected to over-eating, hunger, thirst, fear, detraction, grief, anger or having desire for other man or excessive coitus does not conceive or gives birth to abnormal child.</p>
<p>One should avoid the woman who is too young, too old, suffering from prolonged illness or afflicted with any other disorder.</p>
<p>These very defects are also in the man.</p>
<p>Hence man and woman should join together when they are free from all the defects.</p>
<p>Sa8#6</p>
<p>When they are stimulated well and are favorably disposed for coitus, they should go to the bed well-perfumed, well-covered, and comfortable after taking favorite and wholesome food without over-eating and which the man should ascend with his right leg and the woman with her left one. - Sa8#7</p>
<p>Then they should recite the mantras &#x27;ahirasi&#x27; etc. and &#x27;Brahma&#x27; etc. and then start the sexual act.</p>
<p>Sa8#8</p>
<p>[Influencing the gender and character of the fetus:]</p>
<p>If the woman desires that they should get a son who is big, fair, with reddish brown eyes, vigorous, pure and mentally strong, after bath she should be managed with saturating drink prepared of white barley and mixed with honey and ghee which should be given to her after mixing it with the milk of white cow having similar calf in silver or bronze utensil at every food time for a week continuously.</p>
<p>In the morning she should eat the preparations of sali rice and barley added with curd, honey and ghee or along with milk.</p>
<p>In the evening, she should use white room, bed, seat, drink, dress and ornaments. In the morning and evening, she should gaze constantly at a white and big bull or a horse of good bread pasted with sandal and decorated with ornaments.</p>
<p>She should also be entertained with pleasing and favorite stories.</p>
<p>She should also look at the men and the women having pleasant look, words, behavior and activities and also the fair sense objects.</p>
<p>Her companions and also the husband should entertain her with favorite and wholesome things but the couple should never mix together (sexually).</p>
<p>Living with this method for a week, on the 8th day after taking bath from head she should put on undamaged white clothes and wear white garlands and ornaments. - Sa8#9</p>
<p>Then, first of all, the priest should select a place in the north of the house and having slope towards east or north.</p>
<p>The located place should be pasted with cowdung and water and after sprinkling with water an altar should be made.</p>
<p>On it&#x27;s west side, the priest should take his seat on an undamaged cotton cushion or the hide of a white bull in case of a brahmana, on the hide of a tiger or a bullock in case of a ksatriya and on that of a deer or goat in case of a vaisya.</p>
<p>Having sit there he should collect the sticks of palasa, ingudi, udumbara or madhuka near the fire, spread the kusa grass, delimit with the boundary sticks and scatter the fried paddy grains, white and fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>Then he should make the water vessel purified with sacred (mantras), process the ghee for oblation and place the horse etc. of the said complexion around the place. - Sa8#10</p>
<p>Then the woman expecting a son according to her desire should perform the rites along with her husband, taking her seat in the west of the fire and south of the priest.</p>
<p>Then the priest pointing towards Prajapati should perform the desire-fulfilling rite in the genital parts of the expectant woman with the recitation of mantras as &#x27;visnur yonim&#x27; etc in order to fulfil her desire.</p>
<p>Then he should prepare the bolus after cooking it in an earthen vessel and offer as oblation to the fire thrice according to prescribed method.</p>
<p>He should further give her the water pot purified with sacred mantras for all purposes of water.</p>
<p>After the rite is completed she should go round the fire along with her husband first using her right leg.</p>
<p>Then, after the brahmanas have invocated blessings, the man should first take the remaining ghee and then the woman without leaving any portion.</p>
<p>Thereafter they should join together in sexual intercourse for 8 nights while using the said clothes etc. Thus they procreate a son according to desire.</p>
<p>Sa8#11</p>
<p>The woman who expects a son sky-complexioned with red eyes, broad chest and long arms, or that who expects the same black-complexioned, with black, soft and long hairs, white eyes, white teeth, vigorous and having self-restraint should observe the same procedure of oblation, only the paraphernalia would vary in respect of color.</p>
<p>According to the (desired) complexion of the son, they should use apparel, bed, seat, flower etc.</p>
<p>Sa8#12</p>
<p>The woman belonging to the sudra clan should offer only salutation to gods, fire, brahmanas, preceptor, ascetics and accomplished persons.</p>
<p>Sa8#13</p>
<p>After hearing her desire, the woman should also be advised to travel around the localities mentally which are inhabited by the people simulating the son desired by her.</p>
<p>Moreover, she should also be advised to use diet, behaviour, regimens and apparel customary to the above people.</p>
<p>Thus the entire procedure is described which leads to the excellent result in respect of the desire for a son.</p>
<p>Sa8#14</p>
<p>Not only the above procedure causes a particular complexion but (the relative dominance of mahabhutas too play an important role).</p>
<p>Tejas predominantly associated with ap and akasa gives rise to fair complexion.</p>
<p>&#x27;That&#x27; [tejas predominantly associated ] with prthvi and vayu causes black color.</p>
<p>&#x27;Combined with all these in equal proportion leads to the production of sky-like complexion.&#x27;</p>
<p>Sa8#15</p>
<p>In causation of particular psyche these factors operate– the psychic nature of the parents, frequent acquisition (of informations) by the mother, the past deed and the impact of a particular psyche due to practice (in previous life).</p>
<p>Sa8#16</p>
<p>When the couple processed by the above method join together in sexual intercourse, the undamaged sperm combined with the undamaged ovum, in undamaged genital track and unaffected uterus certainly gives rise to embryo as in a well-washed clean cloth the good dye produces coloring instantly after the contact or the milk combined with curdling yeast attains the form of curd leaving it&#x27;s original character.</p>
<p>The sperm also operates like this.</p>
<p>Sa8#17</p>
<p>The causative factor for the determination of sex in the fetus so formed has already been said.</p>
<p>As an undamaged seed sown (in the field) follows the pattern of it&#x27;s natural characteristics like paddy carrying the characters of paddy, barley carrying the characteristics of barley and so on.</p>
<p>Similarly, the male and the female sex of the fetus also follow the natural characteristics accordingly.</p>
<p>Sa8#18</p>
<p>Change of sex is effected before it&#x27;s manifestation by vedic rites properly performed because the actions performed with excellence of place and time certainly produce desired results otherwise not.</p>
<p>Hence considering the woman as pregnant she should be administered pumsavana</p>
<p>(measures which help procreate a male progeny) before the fetus is manifested.</p>
<p>After taking two undamaged leaf-buds from the easterly and northerly branches of a banyan tree grown in a common place and putting them in curd alongwith two excellent black gram or white mustard seeds, it should be given to the woman to drink in pusya star.</p>
<p>Similarly, the paste of jivaka, rsabhaka, apamarga and saireyaka– collectively or individually as required, added with milk; or putting a kudyakitaka (a type of insect) or matsayka (a small fish) in a handful of water should be given to drink in pusya star.</p>
<p>Small and fire-colored man-shaped pieces of gold, silver or iron put in curd, milk or handful of water should be taken wholly in pusya star.</p>
<p>In the pusya star itself, she should inhale the steam coming from the preparation of sali rice while being cooked.</p>
<p>She should also use a drop with a cotton swab in the right nostril of the liquid made of the flour mixed with water and put on the threshold.</p>
<p>Whatever useful measure for pumsavana is suggested by Brahmanas or reliable ladies, that should also be applied.</p>
<p>Thus the measures for pumsavana are said.</p>
<p>Sa8#19</p>

<p>Aindri, brahmi, satavirya, sahasravirya, viswaksenakanta– wearing of these herbs on head or in right hand; intake of milk or ghee cooked with the same; taking bath with the same in every pusya star.</p>
<p>She should always keep these drugs with her.</p>
<p>Over and above, she should also use constantly all the drugs of Jivaniya group (vitalizers) with the above methods.</p>
<p>Thus the regimens which stabilize the fetus are described.</p>
<p>Sa8#20</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="these-are-the-factors-which-damage-the-fetus">These are the factors which damage the fetus:<a href="#these-are-the-factors-which-damage-the-fetus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to These are the factors which damage the fetus:" title="Direct link to These are the factors which damage the fetus:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The fetus dies in the womb or comes out prematurely or is dried up of the pregnant woman sits on roughened, uneven or hard seat; suppresses the urge of wind, urine and feces, undergoes strenuous and unsuitable physical exercises, takes excessively sharp and hot food or eats very little.</p>
<p>The fetus is also delivered untimely by injury, compression, frequent looking at</p>
<p>ditches, wells and waterfalls, travelling on conveyance with excessive jerking or hearing unliked words or too much noise.</p>
<p>She constantly lies down in supine position, the umbilical cord gets twisted around the neck of the fetus.</p>
<p>The woman sleeping in open place and moving out in night gives birth to an insane;</p>
<p>If she indulges in quarrels and fights, the progeny will be epileptic.</p>
<p>One indulged in sexual intercourse to ill-physiqued, shameless, and devoted to women; One always under grief to timid, underdeveloped or short lived;</p>
<p>One thinking ill of others to harmful, envious or devoted to women;</p>
<p>The thief to exerting, wrathful or inactive;</p>
<p>The intolerant to fierce, deceitful and jealous;</p>
<p>One who sleeps constantly to drowsy, unwise and deficient in digestive power;</p>
<p>One who takes wine constantly to thirsty, poor in memory and unstable in mind;</p>
<p>one using mostly the meat of iguana to an offspring afflicted with gravels, stone or sanairmeha;</p>
<p>One using pork mostly to the offspring having red eyes, obstructed respiration and very rough body hairs;</p>
<p>One using fish constantly to the offspring with delayed closure of eyes or stiff eyes;</p>
<p>One using the sweet things constantly to the offspring suffering from diabetes, dumb or over-obese;</p>
<p>One using sour things constantly to the offspring suffering from internal hemorrhage and disease of skin and eyes;</p>
<p>One using salt constantly to the offspring affected with early wrinkles and grey hairs or baldness;</p>
<p>One using pungent things constantly to weak, deficient in semen and sterile;</p>
<p>One using bitters constantly to consumptive, weak and undeveloped;</p>
<p>One using astringents constantly to blackish progeny suffering from hardness of bowels or udavarta.</p>
<p>The pregnant woman gives birth to a child suffering mostly from the respective disorders the etiological factors of which are used by her.</p>
<p>The paternal defects in respect of semen should be understood on the lines of the mismanagement concerning mother.</p>
<p>Thus the factors causing damage to fetus are said.</p>
<p>Hence the woman desiring excellent progeny should particularly abstain from the unwholesome diet and behavior.</p>
<p>Observing good conduct, she should managed herself with wholesome diet and behavior.</p>
<p>Sa8#21</p>
<p><em>Put all of the above into a chart</em>.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="management-of-diseases-during-pregnancy">Management of Diseases During Pregnancy:<a href="#management-of-diseases-during-pregnancy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Management of Diseases During Pregnancy:" title="Direct link to Management of Diseases During Pregnancy:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>The diseases of the pregnant women should be managed with diet and drugs</p>
<p>consisting mostly of soft, sweet, cold, pleasant and delicate things.</p>
<p>She should never be subjected to evacuative measures like emesis, purgation, head-evacuation, blood-letting, non-unctuous or unctuous enema except in emergent [emergency] conditions.</p>
<p>Since the 8th month, she should be managed in emergent conditions responding to emesis etc. with mild emetics or other measures exerting similar action.</p>
<p>* The pregnant woman has to be managed very cautiously like one carrying a full vessel of oil without agitating it.</p>
<p>Sa8#22</p>
<p>If the mother, due to mismanagement, shows blood during the 2nd or 3rd month, there is little chance of retaining the fetus because during this period the fetus lacks supporting strength.</p>
<p>Sa8#23</p>
<p>If she shows the discharge of menstruation during the 4th month onwards due to anger, grief, envy, jealousy, fear, terror, sexual intercourse, physical exercise, jerk, suppression of urges, sitting, sleeping or standing on uneven ground, excessive hunger and thirst or dirty food, I will explain the method for stabilizing the fetus.</p>
<p>Immediately after the appearance of bleeding she should be advised to lie down on a bed covered with soft, comfortable, cooking bedsheet keeping her head slightly lower.</p>
<p>Then a cotton swab soaked with (the powder of) yastimadhu and ghee which are kept in very cold water should be applied on the perineal region.</p>
<p>She should also be anointed with ghee washed 100 times or 1000 times all over below the navel or she should take cold bath in a tub.</p>
<p>Cloth pieces soaked with the juice of astringent plants having latex should be put inside the vagina, cotton swab of milk and ghee cooked with the leaf-buds of the nyagrodhadi trees should be kept inside the vagina.</p>
<p>She should also take orally 10gm. of these preparations of ghee extracted from milk alone.</p>
<p>She should take as lickable the stamens of lotus, utpala and kumuda (types of waterlily) mixed with honey and sugar.</p>
<p>She should eat water chestnut, lotus seeds and kaseruka.</p>
<p>She should take gandhapriyangu, nilotpala, lotus roots, unripe fruits of udumbara and leaf buds of banyan tree alongwith goat&#x27;s milk.</p>
<p>She should eat soft, fragrant and cooked rice of red sali added with honey and sugar alongwith milk cooked with roots of bali, atibala, sali, sastika and sugarcane and kakili or she should eat the above rice alongwith the meat soup of common quail, grey partridge, kuranga, sambara, harina, ena and kalapucchaka (types of deer) and rabbit well-seasoned with ghee while seated in comfortable, cool and sufficiently airy place.</p>
<p>She should be protected from anger, grief, exertion, sexual intercourse and physical exercise and should be entertained with soothing and favorite stories.</p>
<p>Thus the fetus is stabilized.</p>
<p>Sa8#24</p>
<p>of their contradictory treatments.</p>
<p>Sa8#25</p>
<p>If a pregnant woman uses hot and sharp things and due to this bleeding or another discharge ensues from vagina when the fetus has gained sufficient strength, it does not develop further because of having been discharged. It stays for long and is said as upavistaka by certain scholars.</p>
<p>When a pregnant woman constantly observes fasts and other religious vows in the state of her malnutrition and aversion to fats uses things which aggravate V, the fetus does not develop because it is dried up. This also stays for long without quickening.</p>
<p>This is said as nagodara.</p>
<p>Sa8#26</p>
<p>I will explain the therapeutic management of both the above cases such as– the sue of medicaments which promote the growth of fetus such as ghee and milk cooked with drugs of bhautika (beneficial for the fetus), vitalizer, bulk-promoting, sweet and V-alleviating groups and also of immature fetus (eggs), proper diet alongwith the said ghee etc. having good nutrition and frequent use of vehicles, carriers (horses etc.) cleansing and movements.</p>
<p>Sa8#27</p>
<p>If the fetus is benumbed and does not quicken, the lady should be advised to take soft, sweet and cooled cooked rice of red sali, alongwith meat soup of falcon, fish, gayal cow, peacock, cock, and partrdge added with ghee or soup of black gram or soup of radish added with plenty of ghee.</p>
<p>Moreover, she should be massaged frequently with lukewarm oil in the regions of abdomen, pelvis, groin, thigh, waist, sides and back.</p>
<p>Sa8#28</p>
<p>If the pregnant woman suffers from udavarta and constipation in the 8 month and is not fit to be managed with unctuous enema, she should be treated with non-unctuous enema which may alleviate the disorders.</p>
<p>Udavarta, if neglected, may cause sudden death of the woman alongwith fetus or of the fetus alone. (In this condition) the decoction of the roots of virana, sali, sastika, kusa, kasa, iksuvalika, vetasa and parivyadha and also of bhutika, ananta, kasmarya, parusaka, madhuka and mrdwika prepared in milk added with half water containing the paste of priyala, bibhitakamajja (seed pulp) and sesamum seeds and a bit of salt should be used lukewarm as non-unctuous enema.</p>
<p>When constipation is relieved, she should be sprinkled with lukewarm water and given stabilizing and non-burning food. Thereafter in the evening she should be treated with the unctuous enema by the oil cooked with sweet drugs. These enemas should be administered to her in bending down position.</p>
<p>Sa8#29</p>
<p>If the fetus dies in the womb due to excessive aggravation of dosas or excessive use of sharp and hot things, or suppression of the urges of wind, urine and feces, or use of</p>
<p>uneven seat, bed, standing, compression and injury; or anger, grief, envy, fear, terror etc. or other over-exertive actions by the woman, her abdomen becomes still, stiff, blown up, cold and stony hard containing the fetus devoid of quickening.</p>
<p>Besides, there is severe pain, labor pains do not arise, there is no discharge from vagina, eyes are slackened; she feels darkness before eyes, pain, giddiness, dyspnea and intense restlessness.</p>
<p>The natural urges also do not appear properly.</p>
<p>These are the sings and symptoms of a woman having a dead fetus.</p>
<p>Sa8#30</p>
<p>Some advise applications of the measures prescribed for expulsion of placenta in order to treat the fetus which is converted into a foreign body.</p>
<p>Other recommend the incantation of mantras as prescribed in the Atharvaveda while others advise it&#x27;s extraction by an experienced surgeon.</p>
<p>If the fetus be an immature one, then after extraction of the dead fetus, the woman should first be given adequate drink of any of the [following] sura, sidhu, arista, madhu, madira and asava (types of wine) in order to cleanse the uterus, to induce forgetting the pain and to provide exhilaration.</p>
<p>Thereafter she should be given saturating, strength-protecting but non-fatty diet or gruel etc. that are suitable for the moment till the moisture of dosa and dhatu is absorbed.</p>
<p>Afterwards she should be managed with administration of uncting substance, enema or diet processed with the drugs of appetizer, vitalizer, bulk-promoting, sweet and V-alleviating groups.</p>
<p>In case of mature fetus, she should be managed with unction on the same day when the fetus is extracted.</p>
<p>Sa8#31</p>
<p>If the fetus is developing without any disorder, the following monthly regimen is advised.</p>
<p>During the first month if there be suspicion of conception, the woman should take unprocessed milk cold and in adequate quantity at food times.</p>
<p>She should take only the wholesome food morning and evening.</p>
<p>During the second month, only milk cooked with sweet drugs;</p>
<p>During the 3<sup>rd</sup> month milk added with honey and ghee;</p>
<p>During the fourth month- she should take 10gm. of milk-butter;</p>
<p>During the 5<sup>th</sup> month- ghee extracted from milk.</p>
<p>During the 6<sup>th</sup> month- the above ghee cooked with sweet drugs;</p>
<p>During the 7<sup>th</sup> month- the same as for 6<sup>th</sup> month. Women say that during this month because of appearance of hairs in the fetus, they cause burning sensation in the mother but Lord Atreya says that due to pressure of the fetus V, P and K reaching into the chest give rise to burning sensation, then itching which in turn causes kikkisa (streaking of the skin). To ameliorate this condition, she should take in food times butter processed with sweet drugs alongwith the decoction of kola (jujube). Besides, her breast areola should be massaged gently with the paste of sandal and lotus stalk; or the powder of dhataki, mustard and madhuka; or the paste of kutaja, arjaka seeds, musta and haridra; or the paste of nimba, kola, tulasi and manjistha; or triphala mixed with blood of prsat (spotted deer), deer and rabbit, massage with oil cooked with karavira leaves and sprinkling with water processed with jati and madhuka should be applied. When itching is felt, scratching of the part should be avoided so that the skin may not be</p>
<p>torn or disfigured.</p>
<p>If the itching be intolerable, it may be overcome by anointing and rubbing. During the period she should be kept on a diet consisting of sweet, V-alleviating articles, in a small quantity, free from fat and salt with a little after-drink of water.</p>
<p>During the 8th month- she should take milk gruel added with ghee in food times. But Bhadrakapya it on the plea that it causes the disorder of paingalya (tawniness) in the fetus. On this Lord Punarvasu said– the risk of the disorder of paingalya may be there but it dies not indicate in any way that the above regimen should not be applied. (Rather in my opinion), the women following this remains free from disorders and gives birth to a child endowed with excellent health, strength, complexion, voice and compactness and the best in the entire clan.</p>
<p>During the 9th month- she should be treated with unctuous enema with the oil cooked with sweet drugs. A swab soaked with the same oil should be placed inside the vagina to lubricate the seat of fetus as well as the entire genital tract. If the regimen as mentioned above is followed from the first to the nonth month, it softens the entities which hold the fetus, womb, waist, sides and back of the woman at the time of delivery, wind gets in normal course, urine and feces in normal state get through the passage easily; skin and nails also become soft, strength and complexion are improved and she delivers the child as desired, excellent and healthy with ease and in time.</p>
<p>Sa8#32</p>
<p>Before the 9th month the maternity home should be constructed in a place freed from bones, gravels and earthen pieces and in an ground having soils of good look, taste and smell.</p>
<p>The door should be facing to the east or to the north.</p>
<p>It should be made of the wood from bilva, tinduka, inguda, bhallataka, varuna or khadira or other trees recommended by the brahmanas well-versed in Atharvaveda.</p>
<p>It should have excellent living space, plastering, roofing and door pans and should be provided with, by a good architect, fireplace, water store, place for wooden mortar, lavatory, bathroom and kitchen.</p>
<p>The home should be comfortable for all the seasons.</p>
<p>Sa8#33</p>
<p>The materning home should be equipped with the following drugs and appliances– ghee, oil, honey, rock salt, sauvarcala, kala and bida salts, vidanga, kustha, devadaru, sunthi, pippali, pippalimula, gajapippali, mandukaparni, ela, langali, vaca, cavya, citraka, hingu, sarsapa, lasuna, kataka, kanakanika, nipa, atasi, balwaja, bhurja, kulattha, maireya, sura and asava (types of wine), two stone slabs [[for grinding/ pasting]], two pestles, two mortars, one untamed bull, two sharp golden and silver needles, sharp instruments made of steel, two cots made of bilwa wood, fuel of the wood of tinduka and inguda.</p>
<p>Apart from these appliances, there should be many multipara women possessing friendliness, constant attachment, good manners, presence of mind, affectionate nature, freedom from anxiety, endurance and favorable disposition.</p>
<p>Brahmanas well-versed in Atharvaveda should also be there.</p>
<p>Besides these, whatever is deemed as necessary or advised by the brahmanas and the elderly women should be provided there.</p>
<p>Sa8#34</p>
<p>In the beginning of the 9th month, on an auspicious day when the moon is</p>
<p>auspicious and in conjunction with an auspicious star and in auspicious karana and muhurta offering pacificatory oblations to the fire, cow, brahmana, fire and water should be made to enter fist.</p>
<p>The grasses and water alongwith honey should be offered to the cows and barley grains, flowers and auspicious fruits to brahmanas who should be seated on their seats after offering them water first, and after saluting them and taking sips of water they should be requested to invoke blessings.</p>
<p>Along with the chanting of auspicious mantras the women should enter into the maternity home following the cow and brahmanas and keeping them in the right side.</p>
<p>Then she should wait for the time of delivery.</p>

<p>exhaustion of the body parts, malise on face, laxity in eyes, feeling of the removal of bandage from chest, coming down of the womb, heaviness in lower parts, pain in groin, perineum, waist, belly, sides and back; discharge from the vagina, lack of desire for food; thereafter starting of labor pains and flow of amniotic fluid.</p>
<p>Sa8#36</p>
<p>At the onset of labor pains a bed should be prepared on the ground covered with soft bedding which she should sit on.</p>
<p>Then the women having the said qualities should attend to her surrounding and consoling her with agreeable and sympathetic talks.</p>
<p>Sa8#37</p>
<p>If, in spite of feeling labor pains, she does not deliver she should be told &quot;get up, take one of the pestles and pound the grains put in the mortar slowly, now and then take deep breath and move in between&quot;. Some advise like this, but it is not approved by Lord Atreya. He, on the contrary, says that severe exercise is always contraindicated for the pregnant woman particularly at the time of parturition because at the time in the delicate woman when all the dhatus and doshas are in mobile state, V impelled by the exercise with the pestle and getting opportunity may take away the life because the pregnant woman becomes treatable with difficulty particularly at that time. Hence the holding of pestle is discarded in the view of the sages while deep breathing and movements may be performed. She should be given the powder of kustha, ela, langalaki, vaca, citraka, cirabilva and cavya to smell which she should do frequently. Similarly the smoke of the leaves of bhurja or the heartwood of simsapa may be inhaled, in between she should be kneaded lightly after massaging with lukewarm oil in the region of waist, sides, back and legs. By this manipulation the fetus moves down.</p>
<p>Sa8#38</p>
<p>When it is felt that the fetus leaving the cardiac region is entering into (the lower part of) the abdomen, is being fixed into the brim of the pelvis, the labor pains are getting intensified and the fetus is moving downwards then at this stage she should be placed on</p>
<p>the cot and be advised to strain.</p>
<p>In her ear some favorite lady should recite the following mantras– &quot;Ksitirjalam&quot; etc. (May Prthvi, Ap, Tejas, Vayu, Visnu and Prajapati always protect you, the pregnant one, and promote the delivery of the fetus. O having auspicious look! you, the undistressed one, may deliver the undistressed son having lustre like that of karttikeya and also protected by him.) -#39</p>
<p>The women having the said qualities should advise her like this– &quot;do not strain until the pains appear because who does so her effort goes in vain, moreover her progeny becomes abnormal and deformed or afflicted with dyspnea, cough, phthisis and spleen. As one does not get or gets with difficulty while making efforts for the unimpelled urges of sneezing, eructation, flatus, urine and feces, similar is the fate of the woman who strains for the delivery of the fetus untimely. On the other hand, as the suppression of the impelled urges of sneezing etc. gives rise to afflictions, the non-straining for the delive4ry of fetus in time produces similar results.&quot; She should be asked to follow the instruction. Accordingly, initially she should strain mildly then gradually with stronger effort. While she is straining, the other women should speak in her ears– &quot;just delivered a worthy son&quot;. Thus she is filled with joy.</p>
<p>Sa8#40</p>
<p>When she has delivered the child, immediately it should be observed whether placenta has been expelled or not. In case it has not come out, one of the attending women should press strongly above the navel with the right hand and hold her on the back with the left one and thus shake her body strongly. The pelvic region should be rubbed with her heel. Her buttocks should be held fastly and be pressed strongly. The throat and palate should be touched with her hair braid. The vagina should be fumigated with the leaves of bhurja, kacamani and slough of the serpent. She should be asked to drink the paste of kustha and talisa mixing it in the soup of balwaja or strong spirituous portion of maireya and sura (types of wine), or the soup of horse gram, or decoction of mandukaparni and pippali. The paste of small ela, dewadaru, kustha, sunthi, vidanga, pippali, kalaguru, cavya, citraka and upakuncika; or cutting the right ear of the living untamed bull and pounding it on grinding stone should be kept for an hour in one of the decoctions of balwaja etc.; the liquid portion of this should be administered to the patient. A cotton swab soaked in the oil prepared with satapuspa, kustha, madana and hingu should be placed in her genital tract. Thereafter unctuous enema should be administered to her. The above liquid preparation added with madanaphala, devadali, iksvaku, dhamargava, kutaja, krtavedhana and gajapippali should be used in the form of nonunctuous enema. This non-unctuous enema leads to expulsion of the adhered placenta along with flatus, urine and stool because V does not tend to move contrarily. Flatus, urine and stool and other internal excrements cause adherence of placenta.</p>
<p>Sa8#41</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="care-of-the-post-delivery-new-born-child">[Care of the Post-delivery New-born child:]<a href="#care-of-the-post-delivery-new-born-child" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to [Care of the Post-delivery New-born child:]" title="Direct link to [Care of the Post-delivery New-born child:]" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>While the steps are being taken to expel the placenta, the following actions should be performed in respect of the newly born child, such as: rubbing of stone pieces at the root of the ears, sprinkling of cold or hot water over the face, thus he recovers the vital</p>
<p>breath stopped due to distress so far.</p>
<p>If the fetus is devoid of movements, he should be fanned with a winnowing basket having black flaps till he recovers. (All the above measures may be employed).</p>
<p>When he recovers the breath and becomes normal, he should be bathed and cleaned well with water.</p>
<p>Sa8#42</p>
<p>Thereafter, his palate, lips, throat and tongue should be cleansed with the help of a finger having nail well-cut and putting a well-washed, cushioned cotton swab. After washing his mouth, his anterior fontanel in head should be covered with a cotton swab soaked in some fatty substance. Then vomiting should be induced by administering ghee added with rock salt.</p>
<p>Sa8#43</p>
<p>Then the processing of the cord for which the procedure is explained hereunder. After fixing the point at 8 fingers from the umbilical attachment the cutting point should be held tightly on both sides and cut with a sharp, half-edged instrument made of gold, silver or steel. The end of the attached portion should be tied with thread and attached loosely to the neck of the fetus. If the cut portion suppurates, it should be massaged with the oil prepared with the paste of lodhra, madhuka, priyangu, devadaru and haridra. The powder of the above drugs may also be applied over the part. Thus the processing of the cord is described well.</p>
<p>Sa8#44</p>
<p>On improper processing of the cord, there is risk of the complications such as ayamottundita (vertical swelling), vyayamottundita (horizontal swelling), pindalika (circular hardness), vinamika (marginal swelling) and vijrmbhika (umbilical hernia). This should be treated, according to severity, with massage, anointing and bathing with ghees which are free from burning effect and are able to alleviate V and P.</p>
<p>Sa8#45</p>
<p>Thereafter, the birth rite of the child should be performed such as- first he should be given to ingest the combination of honey and ghee processed with mantras as prescribed in scriptures. Thereafter by the same method, the right breast should be advanced to be suckled (by the child). A water pitcher with mantras should also be kept on the side of his head.</p>
<p>Sa8#46</p>
<p>Now the measures for his protection should be adopted.</p>
<p>The maternity home should be surrounded by the branches of adani, khadira, karkandhu, pilu and parusaka. The seeds of mustard, linseed, rice and kanakanika should be scattered all over the maternity home. The oblation of offering of rice to the fire should be performed continuously twice a day till the naming rite is solimnised. At the door after the threshold a wooden pestle should be kept obliquely. A cloth packet containing caca, kustha, coraka, hingu, mustard, linseed, garlic, kanakanika and other drugs repelling evil spirits and well-tied should be kept at the front door. The same should be worn by the mother as well as the child in the neck and also put in cooking vessels, water jars, cot and both the panels of the door. There should be fire burning constantly with the fuel of kanakanika and tinduka wood within the maternity home. The said attending women and favorite friends should keep up the whole night near the mother for 10 or 12 days. Moreover, gifts, auspicious rites, blessings, praises, songs, playing musical instruments should be performed continuously in the home which should be amply provided with food and drinks and be full of affectionate and happy persons.</p>
<p>The brahmana proficient in the Atharvaveda too should continuously offer propitiatory oblations to the fire both the times for the well-being of the child as well as the mother. Thus the protective measures are said.</p>
<p>Sa8#47</p>
<p>When the mother feels hunger one of the fats– ghee, oil, muscle-fat, marrowshould be given to her according to suitability in the maximum quantiity and mixed with pippali, pippalimula, cavya, citraka and sunthi. After she has taken the fat, her abdomen should be massaged with ghee and oil and wrapped round with a big clean cloth bandage so that V may not find space to produce disorder. After the fat is digested, she should take in proper quantity liquid gruel prepared with pippali etc. and added well with unctuous substance. She should take sprinkles with warm water both the times before the intake of fat and gruel. Thus maintaining for 5 or 7 days she should be saturated gradually. This is the code of the healthy conduct for the woman having recently delivered.</p>
<p>Sa8#48</p>
<p>If any disorder inflicts her during the period, it is curable with difficulty or is incurable because of the <strong>diminution and laxity of all dhatus</strong> caused by the growth of fetus and emptiness due to straining, pain, discharge of fluids and blood. Hence she should be treated with proper method particularly by applying massage, anointing, sprinkling, bath, food and drinks prepared with appetizer, vitalizer, bulk-promoting, sweet and V-alleviating drugs because the women having delivered particularly have vacant body.</p>

<p>On the 10th day, the mother alongwith the baby having taken bath with water containing all aromatic drugs, white mustard and lodhra, having put on light, undamaged and clean cloth, wearing auspicious, desirable, light and splendid ornaments, having touched auspicious objects, having worshipped the appropriate deity should receive blessing invocations from brahmanas possessing hair-lock on the crown of the head, white dress, and no deformity. Then the baby having been placed on the pack of undamaged cloth should be admitted with his head towards the east or the north. Thereafter father of the baby should say that the child is offering salutation to the deity and brahmanas and having said so, the child should be given two names– one based on the constellation at the time of his birth and the other popular name for the day to day use. Of them, the popular name should begin with ghosa (sonant) alphabets and end with antastha (semi-vowel) or usma ones. Besides, there should not be a letter with vrddhi (dipthong), it should be similar to that in preceding generations and should not be newly established. The constellatory name is similar to the deity of the constellation consisting of two or four letters.</p>

<p>After the naming ceremony is over, the child should be examined for the knowledge of the span of his life. These are the features of the children blessed with a long life:</p>
<p>discrete, soft, sparse, oily, deep-rooted and black hairs;</p>
<p>Firm and thick skin,</p>
<p>naturally well-endowed</p>
<p>slightly bigger in size,</p>

<p>shanks neither too corpulent nor too thin, resembling that of deer&#x27;s foot, with hidden blood vessels, bones and joints;</p>
<p>ankles neither too corpulent nor too thin;</p>
<p>feet possessing the above features and tortoise-shaped.</p>
<p>(Apart from these anatomical features) the functions relating to flatus, urine, stool and sexual organs and also sleep, vigil, exertion, smiling, weeping and suckling as normal indicate the long life-span.</p>
<p>Other entities also, which are not mentioned here, if endowed with normal features, are desirable while the contrary ones are undesirable for long life.</p>
<p>Thus the features of the person having long life are explained.</p>
<p>[<em>Put all this page into a chart.]</em> Sa8#51</p>
<p>Now I will explain the examination of wet-nurse:</p>
<p>One should say &quot;Bring the wet-nurse which belongs to the same caste, in youthful age, submissive, free from impatience, deformity, addictions, ugliness and loathsomeness; born in the same place, not mean-minded or indulged in mean acts, born in a good family, having affectionate disposition towards children, free from diseases, having living male children, having profuse lactation, free from carelessness, not sleeping on excrements, not married to a man of lower caste, skill in management, clean, having dislike for uncleanliness and endowed with excellence of breasts and breast milk.[&quot;]</p>
<p>Sa8#52</p>
<p>The excellence of breasts consists of breasts not too high, too long or too corpulent; having nipples of appropriate size and easy in suckling. Thus the excellence of breasts.</p>
<p>Sa8#53</p>
<p>The excellent milk has normal color, smell, taste and touch; dissolves completely in water if milked in a water-pot because of it&#x27;s (watery nature). Such milk is nourishing and health-giving. Thus is the excellence of breast milk.</p>
<p>Sa8#54</p>
<p>The breastmilk having contrary characters should be taken as abnormal. The features are– the breast-milk having blackish or reddish color, astringent as subsidiary taste, non-sliminess, unmanifest smell; which is rough, thin, frothy, light, nonsaturating, emaciating and causing V disorders should be known as affected by V. That which has blue, yellow or coppery tinge; bitter, sour or pungent as subsidiary tastes, fleshy or bloody smell, too hot and causing P disorders should be taken as affected by P and that which is exceedingly white and sweet, has salty as subsidiary taste, smell as that of ghee, oil, muscle-fat and marrow, is slimy, thready, precipitating in water and causing K disorders should be known as affected by K.</p>
<p>Sa8#55</p>
<p>If according to the specific features of these 3 disorders of breast milk, emesis, purgation, non-unctuous and unctuous enema are administered in respective disorders according to dosas, the disorders are alleviated. Food and drink of the woman having affected breast milk should consist mostly of barley, wheat, sali and sastika (types of rice), mudga, harenu and horse gram (pulses), sura, sauviraka, maireya and medaka (fermented liquors), garlic and karanja (vegetables). Measures should be applied after considering the specific morbidity of the breast milk. Administration of the decoction of patha, sunthi, devadaru, musta, murva, guduci, indrayava, kiratatikta, katukarohini and sariva is commended in these disorders. Moreover, the use of other bitter, astringent, pungent and sweet drugs is recommended keeping in view the specific disorder, dosage and time. Thus galacto-depurent measures are said.</p>
<p>Sa8#56</p>
<p>Galactogogues:</p>
<p>Galactogogues are: Wines (except sidhu),</p>
<p>Domestic, marshy and aquatic vegetables Domestic, marshy and aquatic animal meats</p>
<p>Domestic, marshy and aquatic cereals</p>
<p>Food predominant in liquids</p>
<p>Sweet, sour and salty items Herbs possessing latex, Intake of milk Rest</p>
<p>Use of decoction of the roots of virana, sastika, sali [rices], iksuvalika [[sugarcane]], darbha, kusa, kasa, gundra and itkata.</p>
<p>-Thus galactogogues are said.</p>
<p>Sa8#57</p>
<p>When the wet-nurse has sweet, copious and pure milk, she should take bath, apply after-paste, put on white dress and wear one of these herbs- aindri, brahmi, satavirya [satavari? &#x27;100-strength&#x27;? &#x27;sheeta-cooling-action&#x27;? ], vatyapuspi, viswaksenakanta. Then taking the baby with his face towards the east, she should made him suckle the right breast first. Thus the procedure about the wet nurse is said.</p>
<p>Sa8#58</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="the-nursery">[The Nursery:]<a href="#the-nursery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to [The Nursery:]" title="Direct link to [The Nursery:]" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>Hereafter I will describe the nursery for the child. It should be well-planned by the architect. It should be spacious, beautiful, free from darkness and access of wind, well-ventilated, strong, inaccessible for various animals, rats and insects, distinct places for water, pounding, urinal, lavatory, bathroom and kitchen, comfortable in particular season, equipped with cot, chairs and beddings according to season. Moreover, protective measures, offerings, auspicious rites, oblations and expiatory rites should be performed well there and it should be full of clean and elderly persons, physician and affectionate people. Thus the method of nursery is explained.</p>
<p>Sa8#59</p>
<p>The cot, chair, beddings and coverings for the child should be soft, light, clean and perfumed. Those having contact with sweat, excrements and insects or soiled with urine and feces should be discarded. If there be no additional ones, the same may be used after they are cleansed and dried and well-fumigated.</p>
<p>Sa8#60</p>
<p>For fumigation of clothings, cots, beddings and coverings, barley, mustard, linseed, asafotida, guggulu, vaca, coraka [,] vayahstha, golimi, jatila, palankasa, asokarohini and slough of serpent <strong>mixed with ghee</strong> should be used.</p>
<p>Sa8#61</p>
<p>Amulets to be worn by the child [should/ could] be made of the tip of the right horns of the alive rhinoceros, deer, gayal or bull; the herbs like aindri etc. or jivaka and rsabhaka, or whatever the brahmanas conversant in the Atharvaveda may prescribe.</p>
<p>Sa8#62</p>
<p>Toys for the child should be variegated, sound-producing, beautiful, not heavy, without sharp ends, those which cannot enter into the mouth, are not fatal or terrifying. Sa8#63</p>
<p>Frightening the child is not proper. Hence when the child weeps or does not eat or is attracted to somebody else, one should not try to subside him by frightening with calling the names of raksasas, pisacas, putana etc.</p>
<p>Sa8#64</p>
<p>If some illness comes to the child, the physician after examining cautiously the constitution, etiology, prodroma, symptoms and therapeutic suitability and knowing about all the factors should start the treatment with sweet, mild, light, fragrant, cold and beneficial measures keeping in view the peculiarities of the place and time because the children are suited to such measures and they get prolonged relief from the same. In case of health, he should be maintained on the code of conduct for the healthy using the things contrary to place, time and his self-constitution. The unwholesome habits should be changed gradually to the wholesome ones and thus all unwholesome should be avoided. Thus he attains the excellence of strength, complexion, body and life-span.</p>
<p>Sa8#65</p>
<p><strong>&quot;In this way, the child should be looked after till he is adult and gets skill to acquire virtue and means of sustenance.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Sa8#66</p>
<p>Thus the measures for fulfilling the desire to have a son are described following which properly one attains sufficient honor without any envy for others.</p>

<p>&quot;What is that of a man which having 4 constituents and 6 sources and which coming out of him while cohabiting with a women of a different clan in a lonely place after the period of her menses is converted into embryo in the women.&quot;</p>
<p>Sa2#2-3</p>
<p>The wise call it &#x27;sukra&#x27; (semen), which is implanted for the origin of the embryo. It is constituted of 4 quarters: vayu, agni, prthvi and ap (4 mahabhutas) and is originated from (food consisting of) 6 rasas.</p>
<p>Sa2#4</p>
<p>How and with what factors is the fetus delivered fully developed in time and with ease?</p>
<p>How does even a fertile women face delay in conception and why sometimes is the embryo destroyed?</p>
<p>Sa2#5</p>
<p>By the excellence of sperm, ovum, the self, uterus and time and by management with wholesome diet the normal fetus gets delivered in fully developed state, in time and with ease.</p>
<p>Sa2#6</p>
<p>Though fertile, a women gets conceived after a long time due to defects in genitals, mental worry, derangement of sperm, ovum, diet and behavior; absence of proper timing and diminution of strength.</p>
<p>Sa2#7</p>
<p>The menstrual blood obstructed by V in a women is taken as pregnancy sometimes by the ignorant.</p>
<p>The blood not flowing out and gradually accumulated produces signs and symptoms of pregnancy. - Sa2#8</p>
<p>When that blood is discharged out due to exposure to fire, the sun, exertion, anxiety, other diseases and intake of hot food and drinks, some people observing the same, though it is not fetus, say it as destroyed by the evil spirit. - Sa2#9</p>
<p>The body (of the fetus) is not desired for the purpose of eating by those (evil spirits) eating away ojas and moving in nights.</p>
<p>If they do not get entrance into the mother&#x27;s body and inflict her ojas, they would not be able to destroy the fetus.</p>
<p>Sa2#10</p>
<p>Why does one female get male child?</p>
<p>Why does one get twins- male or female, separate or joined, or several children [at once]?</p>
<p>Why does one deliver the child with delay?</p>
<p>Why does one of the twins develop more?</p>
<p>Sa2#11</p>
<p>One gets female or male child due to dominance of ovum or sperm respectively.</p>
<p>Sa2#12</p>
<p>When zygote is split into 2, the twin is formed and the female or male character of the same is determined by the relative predominance of ovum or sperm respectively.</p>
<p>Sa2#12</p>
<p>When the zygote is bifurcated with dominance of sperm the women delivers male twin jointly or with that of ovum she delivers female twin jointly.</p>
<p>Sa2#13</p>
<p>A women delivers that number of children due to past deeds and god&#x27;s pleasure in which the excessively aggravated V afflicting the union of sperm and ovum splits the same variously.</p>
<p>Sa2#14</p>
<p>If the fetus does not get nourishment and consequently gets dried up or discharged, the women delivers the child after a long time when the fetus is developed even in several years [!].</p>
<p>Sa2#15</p>
<p>Due to past deeds and uneven bifurcation of the union of sperm and ovum one in the twin develops more in the womb while the other one is less. Thus there is also differentiation in the twin.</p>
<p>Sa2#16</p>
<p>Why does the progeny become as hermaphrodite, pavanendriya, samskaravahi[,] narasandha or narisandha (sterile man or women), vakri, irsyabhirati and vatikasandhaka? Sa2#17</p>
<p>In case the zygote has sperm and ovum equally or is damaged in &#x27;genitci&#x27; [genetic] portion the progeny has characters of both female and male and as such is called <strong>&#x27;Dwiretas&#x27; (hermaphrodite)</strong>.</p>
<p>V having afflicted the location of semen in the fetus causes <strong>Pavanandriya (devoid of semen)</strong>.</p>
<p>When V obstructs the passage of the location of semen, it causes <strong>Samskaravahi (condition of aphrodisia)</strong>.</p>
<p>When the parents have sluggish and diminished reproductive factor, are weak, unstimulated and with damaged genetic portion, they cause the 2 disorders: <strong>male and female sterility</strong>.</p>
<p>Due to mother&#x27;s lack of desire (for coitus) or complicated posture (during coitus) and also due to genetic deficiency of father, <strong>Vakri (with curved organ)</strong> is caused.</p>
<p><strong>Irsyabhirati</strong> is caused if the parents are subdued by jealousy and have mild passion.</p>
<p>When the testicles get destroyed by aggravation of V and agni, <strong>Vatika Sandhaka</strong> is produced.</p>
<p>&quot;Thus 8 types of genetic sexual disorders due to past deeds should be [known and] determined.&quot;</p>
<p>Sa2#18-21</p>
<p>impregnated in the womb?</p>
<p>What is the reason of resemblance of the child?</p>
<p>Sa2#22</p>
<p>Salivation, heaviness, malaise, drowsiness, horrpilation, distress in cardiac region, contentment, holding up of zygote in uterus– these are the symptoms of the conception which has just taken place.</p>
<p>Sa2#23</p>
<p>Activities mostly in left parts, desire for man, womanly dreams, drinks, food, conduct, and activities, fetus stationed in the left side of the womb, &#x27;gravid uterus not round&#x27;, profuse lactation in the left breast– these indicate the female fetus.</p>
<p>Sa2#24</p>
<p>Symptoms contrary to the above indicate the male fetus.</p>
<p>The third sex (enunch) is indicated by the mixed symptoms.</p>
<p>Sa2#25</p>
<p>A woman gets child resembling that which her mind is attracted to during conception.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[So, if she is thinking about a male child during conception, she will get a male child.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sa2#26</p>
<p>All the fetuses have 4 mahabhutas <strong>(all except akasa)</strong> which are fourfold such as– maternal, paternal, nutritional and self-borne.</p>
<p>Because of them the dominant factors arisen out of the past deeds of the parents determine resemblance of the physical appearance.</p>
<p>Likewise, resemblance of mental faculty is also determined by the <strong>past life or species</strong>.</p>
<p>[So, if a person had been an eagle in the previous reincarnation, he may be a sharp thinker in the present life. If he had been a cow in the previous reincarnation, he may be very compassionate in this life.]</p>
<p>Sa2#27</p>
<p>How does the self transmigrate from one body to another and which is it ever associated with?</p>
<p>Sa2#28</p>
<p>Due to defects of genes, the self, past deeds, uterus, time and mother&#x27;s food and behavior, the vitiated dosas produce various abnormalities in shape, complexion and sense organs.</p>
<p>As in the rainy season, wood, stone pieces and water current cause derangement in a tree situated in the river stream, doshas cause abnormalities in fetus situated in the womb.</p>
<p>Sa2#29-30</p>
<p>The self along with subtle 4 bhutas and with speed like that of mind transmigrate from one body to the other according to past deeds.</p>
<p>It can not be seen without divine visual sense.</p>
<p>He is omnivagant, sustains all bodies, performs all actions, takes all forms.</p>
<p>He is the source of consciousness, transcending all senses, ever-united and closely attached.</p>
<p>In the body, bhutas are 16 (out of 4 bhutas each being of 4 types)-- such as caused by maternal nutrition, the self, mother (ovum) and father (sperm).</p>
<p>Out of them, 4 are associated with the self and the self, in turn, depends on these 4 (for his manifestation).</p>
<p>The bhutas derived from mother and father are represented by ovum and sperm in the fetus.</p>
<p>Those by which the sperm and ovum are nourished are derived from (mother&#x27;s) nutrition.</p>
<p>4 bhutas are derived from past deeds which having merged with the self enter into the fetus because the self with seed-like character always transmigrates himself from one body to the other (in a cycle order). According to past deeds, form arises from (the past) form and mind from (the past) mind.</p>
<p>Whatever difference is observed in physique and psyche is caused by rajas and tamas as well as the past deed.</p>
<p>Sa2#31-36</p>
<p>The self is never dissociated with too subtle and sense-transcending (bhutas), past deeds, mind, intellect, ego and other evils of the products (of primordial nature).</p>
<p>Mind is associated with rajas and tamas; all defects are caused by ignorance.</p>
<p>The cause of movement and inclination is defective mind and potent past deeds.</p>
<p>Sa2#37-38</p>
<p>Whenceforth are the disease?</p>
<p>What is their remedy?</p>
<p>What is the cause of happiness and sorrow?</p>
<p>How should physical and mental disorders once subdued not recur?</p>
<p>Sa2#39</p>
<p>Intellectual error, unbalanced use of senses and consequence of time; these 3 are the causes of all the disorders.</p>
<p>Similarly, the remedy of all disorders consists of the balanced use of intellect, senses and time.</p>
<p>Sa2#40</p>
<p>Virtuous acts bring forth happiness, while the contrary ones lead to sorrow.</p>
<p>Sources of diseases is body and mind, when these body and mind are absent, the disease cannot recur.</p>
<p>Sa2#41</p>
<p>The continuity of physique and psyche is beginningless.</p>
<p>Their absence [achieving enlightenment; freedom from the physical world] can be brought out only by excellent restrain, memory and knowledge.</p>
<p>Sa2#42</p>
<p>Even though the above-mentioned 2-fold seats of diseases exist, one should always take precautions against diseases.</p>
<p>One having overcome the senses does not fall a prey to diseases except predestined at the moment.</p>
<p>Sa2#43</p>
<p>The deeds of the previous life are known as daiva (fate) and those of the present life as paurusa (personal effort).</p>
<p>These in unbalanced way cause diseases while in balanced way avert the diseases. Sa2#44</p>
<p>One eliminating the accumulation of doshas of (early winter) in (spring), those of summer in early rains and those of rainy season in autumn, never suffers from seasonal disorders.</p>
<p>Sa2#45</p>
<p>The man who uses wholesome diet and behavior, moves cautiously, is unattached to sensual pleasures, donates, observes equality, is truthful, forbearing and devoted to the persons of authority becomes free from diseases. -#46</p>
<p>One who is endowed with excellent intellect, speech and action leading to happy consequence, submissive mind, clear understanding, knowledge, penance and continued effort in yoga, does not fall a victim to diseases.</p>

<p>Su 3</p>
<p>When there is cohabitation of man having undamaged sperm and woman having undamaged genital tract, ovum and uterus during the rtukala (opportune period) and consequently the conscious (self) impelled by mind descend into the zygote situated in the uterus, the embryo is formed.</p>
<p>It grows with the utilization of suitable nourishment and managed properly, devoid of abnormality.</p>
<p>Then at the proper time, while endowed with all the sensory organs, well developed body and excellence of strength, complexion, mind and compactness, it is delivered with ease.</p>
<p>The embryo is produced by these factors- mother, father, self, suitability and nutrition and mind is also there as an associate.</p>
<p>Su3#3</p>
<p>&#x27;No&#x27; said Bharadwaja, &#x27;Why? Because none of the factors- mother, father, self, suitability, use of nutrients in various forms such as- drinkables, eatables, chewable and lickables, produces embryo nor does mind descend from the other world into the embryo.[&#x27;]</p>
<p>Su3#3.1</p>
<p>If the parents were capable of producing the embryo, the majority of men and women who have longing for sons should produce sons only by cohabiting with the desire therefor or those desiring daughters should produce the same.</p>
<p>Moreover, none of the men and women should be childless nor should such persons be aggrieved (because of having no progeny).</p>
<p>Su3#3.2</p>
<p>The self also does not produce himself.</p>
<p>Because in that case the question would arise whether the self does it while born or unborn and in both ways it is untenable.</p>
<p>Because the born self cant&#x27; produce himself as he is already there and how would the unborn one would do as he is non-existing, hence in both ways it is illogical.</p>
<p>Moreover, suppose, the self is capable of producing himself, why does he not give birth only in desired species and also as endowed with supreme power, unobstructed movements, power of taking forms at pleasure, brilliance, strength, speed, complexion, psyche and compactness and also as devoid of old age, disease and death, because the self wants himself to be like this or even better.</p>
<p>Su3#3.3</p>
<p>The embryo is also not caused by suitability because if it were so, the person using suitable things alone should get progeny and on the other hand, those using unsuitable things should be wholly childless but both are seen in both cases.</p>
<p>Su3#3.4</p>
<p>the men and women should be childless as there is none who do not take nutrition.</p>
<p>If it is meant that excellence of nutrition produces embryo, then the persons <strong>using the meat of goat, sheep, deer and peacock, cow&#x27;s milk, curd, ghee, honey, oil, rocksalt, sugarcane juice, green gram and sali rice alone</strong> should get offspring; and those eating syamaka, varaka, uddalaka, koradusaka, tubers and roots (inferior cereals and edibles) should be wholly childless.</p>
<p>But both are seen in both cases.</p>
<p>Su3#3.5</p>
<p>Not also the psyche descends from the other world into the embryo because in that case nothing of the past life should be unknown, unheard or unseen but it does not remember anything.</p>
<p>Su3#3.6</p>
<p>Therefore, I [Baradwaja] say– the embryo is not produced of mother, father, self, suitability, nutrition and the psyche is also not associated in this.</p>
<p>Su3#4</p>
<p>Lord Atreya said– &#x27;no&#x27;, all these entities combined together give rise to embryo. Su3#5</p>
<p>The embryo is produced by mother.</p>
<p>There can&#x27;t be origin of embryo without mother nor can the viviparous ones be produced without her.</p>
<p>The entities which are particularly maternal and are produced from mother are these such as– skin, blood, flesh, fat, navel, heart, kloma [pancreas], liver, spleen, kidneys, urinary bladder, colon, stomach, intestine, rectum, anus, small intestines, large intestines, omentum and mesentary– these are derived from mother.</p>
<p>Su3#6</p>
<p>The embryo is produced from father, there can be no origin of embryo nor can there be birth of viviparous beings.</p>
<p>The entities which are particularly paternal and are derived from father are these such as– head hairs, beards-mustaches, nails, body hairs, teeth, bones, veins, ligaments and semen (these are derived from father).</p>
<p>Su3#7</p>
<p>The embryo is produced of the self.</p>
<p>The self of embryo is the internal self which is known as &#x27;jiva&#x27; (source of life) and also as ever-continuing, devoid of illness, old age, death and decay; not subjected to incision, excision, agitation; having universal forms and actions, unmanifest, beginningless as well as endless and without any transformation.</p>
<p>He entering into the uterus and combining with sperm and ovum produces himself in the form of embryo that is why the embryo is called as &#x27;the self&#x27;.</p>
<p>The birth of that self is not possible because of his beginning-less-ness.</p>
<p>Hence (both the statement that) he produces the unborn embryo while born and unborn are incorrect.</p>
<p>The same fetus by the lapse of time attains the stages of childhood, youth and old age gradually.</p>
<p>&#x27;During the stage which he exists in, he is called as born (or become) while during the preceding stage he was would be born (or become)&#x27;.</p>
<p>In this way, he is both born and unborn simultaneously.</p>
<p>Where both these– born-ness and unborn-ness– are present he is produced while born and the same in future conditions produces himself while unborn.</p>
<p>In fact, birth is only transformation in respect of age and conditions.</p>
<p>For instance, in spite of sperm, ovum and the self, they do not attain the state of embryo until they are combined together, this comes into existence by combination.</p>
<p>Similarly, the same person does not attain fatherhood before the birth of progeny which thereafter does.</p>
<p>In the same way, the embryo, though existing, is said as born or unborn in respective stages.</p>
<p>Su3#8</p>
<p>Mother, father or the self are not able to effect at pleasure in respect of all entities of the embryo.</p>
<p>Somewhat they do by themselves and other under the influence of the paste deed, at some places their instruments are potent while at others they are not.</p>
<p>Where there is excellence of instruments like psyche etc. they produce effect at pleasure according to strength otherwise the results are contrary.</p>
<p>It does not mean that due to defect of instrument, the self himself has no effective role in production of embryo because the knowers of the self have observed that the desired species, supreme power and emancipation are dependent on the self.</p>
<p>There is none else agent of happiness and misery.</p>
<p>The embryo wile being born can not be produced by the factor other than the self. The sprout can not grow from non-seed (that which does not poses the character of seed).</p>
<p>Su3#9</p>
<p>The aspects of embryo caused by the self are these such as– birth in a particular species, life-span, self-knowledge, mind, sense organs, respiration, impulse, sustenance, characteristic physiognomy, voice and complexion, happiness, misery, desire-aversion, consciousness, restraint, intellect, memory, ego and will. (These are caused by the self).</p>
<p>Su3#10</p>
<p>The embryo is produced from suitability. No factor other than the use of unsuitable things causes sterility in men and women nor is there any abnormality in the embryo.</p>
<p>Three doshas even vitiated and spreading over the body in men and women using unsuitable things do not affect the conception of embryo until sperm, ovum and uterus are damaged.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in men and women using suitable things and even though having sperm, ovum and uterus undamaged and cohabiting in opportune period, conception does not take place because of non-descent of the life-principle.</p>
<p>The embryo is produced not only from suitability alone but from the aggregate of all the factors.</p>
<p>The entities derived from the suitability are these such as– freedom from diseases, illness, and greed; cheerfulness of senses, excellence of voice, complexion and reproductive factor (sperm and ovum), and excessive stimulation (these are derived from suitability).</p>
<p>Su3#11</p>
<p>Embryo is produced from nutrition.</p>
<p>Without nutrition even survival of the mother would not be possible, so what to speak of the growth of the embryo?</p>
<p>By malnutrition, conception of embryo is not possible but proper nutrition alone</p>
<p>is not capable for this, the aggregate of all factors is the cause.</p>
<p>The entities derived from nutrition are these such as– formation of the body, growth, continuance of vital breath, contentment, corpulence and vigor. (These are derived from nutrition).</p>
<p>Su3#12</p>
<p>The psyche is an associate in this which alongwith with life-principle comes in contact with the body; preceding the departure of which there is contrast in conduct and inclinations, all senses are deranged, strength is diminished, diseases grow, devoid of which one expires; which is known as &#x27;mind&#x27;, the supporter of the sense organs.</p>
<p>The psyche is of 3 types– pure, rajasa and tamasa.</p>
<p>The quality which is dominant in mind associates in the subsequent birth as well. IN case the psyche is pure, one recollect the (incidents of) the previous birth also.</p>
<p>This sort of recollective knowledge comes forth by the association of mind with the self on the basis of which the person is said as &#x27;Jatismara&#x27; (one who recollects the previous life).</p>
<p>The entities which are derived from the psyche are these such as- inclination, conduct, cleanliness, aversion, memory, attachment, detachment, envy, valor, fear, anger, drowsiness, vogro, intensity, softness, seriousness, instability and other psychic features which will be described later on in the context of classification of psyche.</p>
<p>Psyche is of various types which are found all in a person but not simultaneously. One psyche is said because of dominance of one or the other type.</p>
<p>Su3#13</p>
<p>Thus the embryo is produced from the aggregate of all these factors.</p>
<p>For instance, the roof-chamber is constructed from the aggregate of several materials and the chariot is formed from the combination of several parts.</p>
<p>Therefore I [Atreya] said– the embryo is produced from mother, father, self, suitability and nutrition and the psyche as an associate in this act. (As said Lord Atreya). Su3#14</p>
<p>Bharadwaja again asked- If the embryo is produced from these various procreative factors, how is it unified?</p>
<p>If unified, how does the embryo born of the aggregate take the human shape as man is born of a man?</p>
<p>In case this is argued that as a man is born of a man, it takes the human shape such as</p>
<p>cow is born of a cow, horse of a horse and so on; the earlier proposition that it is made of aggregate would become untenable.</p>
<p>If man is born of a man, why are the offsprings of the dull, blind, hunch-backed, dumb, dwarf, with nasal utterance, freckles, insanity, leprosy and leucoderma not similar to their parents?</p>
<p>If it is solved like this that the self perceives visions with his own visual organ, sounds with the auditory organ, smell with the olfactory organ, taste with the gustatory organ, touch with the tactile organ and knowables with the intellect and as such the offspring of the dull etc are not similar to their parents, then it would go contradiction of the proposition itself.</p>
<p>In this case, the self, in presence of the sense rogans, will be conscious otherwise unconscious and that self where both conscious as well as unconsciousness exist, will become changeable.</p>
<p>If the self perceives the objects with the visual organs etc., then in the absence of these organs he would not perceive the sense objects and thus would be unconscious and thereby non-cause which would destroy the basis of the self.</p>
<p>Thus this proposition would be reduced to mere jugglery of words and quite meaningless. (Thus said Bharadwaja).</p>
<p>Su3#15</p>
<p>Atreya replied– It is already said earlier that the psyche associated with the lifeprinciple comes in contact with the body.</p>
<p>How the embryo is formed in human shape from the aggregate and man is born of a man is explained hereunder.</p>
<p>There are 4 types of genetic source of animals- Jarayu (fetal &#x27;memberances&#x27;), egg, sweat and coming out of the earth.</p>
<p>Of these 4 classes, each class has innunerable variations because of innumerable shapes of creatures.</p>
<p>In case of viviparous and oviparous animals, these precreative factors attain the shape according to the species where they operate.</p>
<p>For instance, gold, silver, copper, tin and lead poured into respective moulds of bee&#x27;s wax (make various products), when they are poured into the man-shaped mould the product will be in the human form.</p>
<p>In the same way, the embryo produced from the aggregate attains the human form.</p>
<p>It is observed that man is born of a man because of his belonging to the human species.</p>
<p>Su3#16</p>
<p>As to the query that if a man is born of a man why the offsprings of the dull etc. are not similar to their parents it is said that in the seed (sperm or ovum), the part of the body which is damaged in it&#x27;s genetic source gets abnormality otherwise not.</p>
<p>Hence both types of cases are observed.</p>
<p>The sense organs of all are self-derived and their presence or absence is dependent on fate.</p>
<p>Therefore, the offsprings of the dull etc. are not invariably similar to their parents. Su3#17</p>
<p>This is not a fact that the self is conscious in presence of sense organs otherwise</p>
<p>not because the self is never dissociated with the psyche and from a particular psyche a particular knowledge is acquired.</p>
<p>Su3#18</p>
<p>The agent can not proceed for knowledge and consequent action in absence of sense organs.</p>
<p>The action which is dependent on certain entities do not exist without them such as the potter is helpless in his action, in spite of his knowledge, in absence of earth.</p>
<p>Su3#19</p>
<p>Now hear the spiritual knowledge because the knowledge of the self is great one. After controlling his sense organs, concentrating his unstable mind, the knower of the self enters into the spiritual field and becomes stationed in his own knowledge.</p>
<p>Thus with his concentrated knowledge everywhere, he examines all the entities. Su3#20-21</p>
<p>O Bharadwaja! hear another fact, one while asleep and having his sense organs, speech and activities stopped does not perceive the sense object nor does feel happiness or misery (but still he is conscious and) as such (only on non-perception of senses) he can not be treated as unconscious.</p>
<p>No unified knowledge can flow without the knowledge of the self.</p>
<p>There is no any independent entity nor is that causeless.</p>
<p>Su3#22-24</p>
<p>&quot;Thus O Bharadwaja! the conscious, the source of origin, the self, the seer and the cause– all this has been explained with certainty. <strong>&quot;Now remove your doubts.&quot; *</strong> Su3#25</p>
<p>Summing up– The cause of origin, birth and growth, the views of Punarvasu and Bharadwaja refutation of preposition, and clear conclusion about self– all this is explained in the minor chapter on descent in embryo.</p>
<p>Su3#26-27</p>
<p>(( All of the above is from Chapter 3 Sarirasthana pages 418-427 ))</p>
<p>OM NAMAH GURU OM NAMAH SRI PUNARVASU ATREYA</p>
<p>Sa 4</p>
<p>The factors from which the embryo is originated, definition of embryo, factors producing the embryo, the order of it&#x27;s development, the cause of development, factors hindering it&#x27;s birth, factors leading to it&#x27;s destruction in the womb and those causing morbidity though not fully destroying it- all this will be explained in this chapter.</p>
<p>Sa4#3</p>
<p>Embryo is originated by the aggregate of these entities- mother, father, self, suitability, nutrition and psyche.</p>
<p>The different parts being originated from these factors as maternal, paternal etc. have already been said earlier.</p>
<p>Sa4#4</p>
<p>The combination of sperm, ovum and life-principle implanted in the womb is known as embryo.</p>
<p>Sa4#5</p>
<p>Embryo is the product of akasa, vayu, tejas, ap and prthvi being the seat of consciousness.</p>
<p>Thus, embryo is the aggregate of the 5 mahabhutas being the seat of the consciousness which is regarded as the sixths constituent of embryo.</p>
<p>Sa4#6</p>
<p>(Now) the order in which the embryo is formed is explained.</p>
<p>After the accumulated menstrual blood is discharged and the new one is situated, the woman having cleanly bathed and with undamaged genital passage, ovum and uterus is called as having opportune period.</p>
<p>When the man having undamaged sperms cohabits with such a woman, his semen, the essence of all the sariradhatus, is extracted from the whole body impelled by orgasm.</p>
<p>Thus being impelled by the self in the form of orgasm and also seated by him, the semen having potentiality of a seed, is ejaculated from the man&#x27;s body and through the proper track enters into the uterus and combines with the ovum.</p>
<p>Sa4#7</p>
<p>There, first of all the principle of consciousness comes forward alongwith psyche to receive the qualities (of mahabhtuas).</p>
<p>He is hetu, karana, nimitta (cause), aksara (un-decaying), karat (doer), manta (thinker), vedita (perceptor), boddha (knower), drasta (seer), dharta (sustainer), brahma (creator), viswakarma (performing universal function), viswarupa (takgin universal forms), purusa (lying in the body), prabhava (source of origin), avyaya (undamagable), nitya (eternal), guni (having qualities), grahana (reciever), pradhana (principal), avyakta (unmanifest), jiva (life principle), Jna (conscious), pudgala (ego), cetanavan (having sensation), vibhu (omnipresent), bhutama (essence of creatures), indriyatma (essence of sense organs) and antaratma (inner essence).</p>
<p>At the time of receiving the qualities, , he, first of all, takes up akasa.</p>
<p>As the undecaying self with desire to create the beings at the end of the final destruction (of creation) creates, with the psyche as instrument, first of all, akasa thereafter gradually the other 4 elements vayu etc. having more manifest qualities.</p>
<p>At the time of putting on the body also he takes up akasa itself first of all and then the other 4 elements vayu etc. with more manifest qualities gradually.</p>
<p>The entire process of receiving the qualities (of mahabhutas by uniting with them)</p>
<p>is completed within a subtle measure of time. [very brief/ slow].</p>
<p>Sa4#8</p>
<p>Thus endowed with all the qualities while taking the form of embryo, during the first month it is completely mixed up and made turbid with all the constituents and like phlegm having unmanifest form and body parts both as manifest and un-manifest.</p>
<p>Sa4#9</p>
<p>During the second month, it is solidified as a small bolus, elongated muscle or tumor-like which indicate male, female and &#x27;enunch&#x27; respectively.</p>
<p>Sa4#10</p>
<p>During the 3rd month, all the body parts are formed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Sa4#11</p>
<p>Some of the body parts have already been said earlier classified as maternal etc.</p>
<p>Now these will be mentioned along with some other entities from the point of view of the products of the mahabhutas.</p>
<p>In fact, the maternal etc. are also the products of the mahabhutas.</p>
<p>Those derived from akasa are sound, the auditory organ, lightness, minuteness, distinction.</p>
<p>Touch, the tactile organ, roughness, impulsion, shaping of dhatus and physical activities are derived from vayu.</p>
<p>Those derived from tejas are vision, the visual organ, light, digestion and heat.</p>
<p>Those derived from ap are taste, the gustatory organ, coldness, softness, unction and moistening.</p>
<p>Those derived from prthvi are smell, olfactory organ, heaviness, stability and mass.</p>
<p>Sa4#12</p>
<p>Thus the person is equal to the universe.</p>
<p>Whatever formed entities are found in the universe, they are also found in the person and vice versa.</p>
<p>The learned people want to see the phenomena with this angle.</p>
<p>Sa4#13</p>
<p>Thus his sense organs and other body parts appear simultaneously except those entities which come forth after birth such as– teeth, secondary sex characters, manifestation of sex characters and other similar entities.</p>
<p>This is the normal pattern, and otherwise is an abnormal pattern.</p>
<p>In the fetus, some entities are permanent while others are temporary.</p>
<p>His body parts which are manifested carry the features of female, male or enunch.</p>
<p>The characteristic features of female and male depend on the self or the mahabhutas and are determined according to the dominance of one or the other factor such as– want of valor, timidity, lack of skill, confusion, instability, heaviness in lower parts, intolerance, laxity, tenderness, genetic factor for uterus and other similar entities determine the female sex, contrary to these determine the male sex, the characteristics of both types denote the &#x27;enunch&#x27;.</p>
<p>Sa4#14</p>
<p>The fetus attains the free flow of consciousness in his mind at the very time when the sense organs are manifested.</p>
<p>Hence then onwards the fetus pulsates and expresses the desire for whatever is experienced in the previous life, this is called by the elders as the state of two hearts.</p>
<p>His heart which is maternally derived gets connected with the mother&#x27;s heart through vessels carrying nutrition.</p>
<p>Hence their desire is transmitted through them.</p>
<p>Due to this reason it is not desirable to ignore the (desires of) fetus expressed through the mother.</p>
<p>In case the same are ignored, there may be destruction or morbidity (in the fetus).</p>
<p>At this stage, the mother becomes equal to the fetus for acquisition and maintenance in respect of certain things.</p>
<p>Therefore, the wise manage the pregnant lady with liked and wholesome things. Sa4#15</p>
<p>Now I shall mention, in brief, the signs and symptoms of pregnancy and the state of 2 hearts.</p>
<p>The management depends on knowledge which, in turn, depends on signs and symptoms, hence description of signs and symptoms is necessary; such as– disappearance of menstruation, excessive salivation, loss of desire for food, vomiting, anorexia, liking for sour things, inclination towards good or bad things, heaviness in body, malaise in eyes, appearance of milk in breasts, excessive blackness in lips and the areola of breasts, slight edema in feet, appearance of the line of small hairs, dilatation of vagina– these are the symptoms of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Sa4#16</p>
<p>Whatever she wants should be provided to her except those which damage the fetus.</p>
<p>Sa4#17</p>
<p>These are the factors which damage the fetus such as– all food articles which are very heavy, hot and irritant as well as severe activities.</p>
<p>The elders also advise like this– she should not wear red clothes in order to prevent the (attacks of) gods, demons and their followers, she should not take intoxicating wines, ride on vehicles, eat meat, should abstain completely from the things which are unfavorable to all the sense organs and such others which (elderly) women know (and advise).</p>
<p>Sa4#18</p>
<p>In case the desire is too intense, even the unwholesome thing may be given to her added with the wholesome one with a view to satisfying her desire.</p>
<p>Suppression of the desire, V gets vitiated and moving inside the body causes destruction or deformity in the ensuing fetus.</p>
<p>Sa4#19</p>
<p>During the 4th month, the fetus attains stability and as such the pregnant woman feels particular heaviness in the body.</p>
<p>Sa4#20</p>
<p>During the 5th month, in fetus flesh and blood are developed more in comparison to other months, hence the pregnant woman gets particularly lean and thin.</p>
<p>Sa4#21</p>
<p>During the 6th month, the fetus is developed more in respect of strength and complexion, hence the pregnant woman particularly loses strength and complexion during this period.</p>
<p>Sa4#22</p>
<p>During the 7th month, the fetus is developed in respect of all entities, hence the pregnant woman become overall exhausted during the period.</p>
<p>Sa4#23</p>
<p>During the 8th month, the fetus and mother exchange ojas mutually now and again through nutrient-carrying vessels because of the immaturity of the fetus.</p>
<p>Hence during the period the pregnant woman sometimes becomes exhilarated and sometimes depressed, similarly the fetus.</p>
<p>So then the delivery of the fetus [in this month; prematurely] is entailed with calamity due to instability of ojas.</p>
<p>Looking to this, the experts treat the 8th month as &#x27;unreckonable&#x27;.</p>
<p>Sa4#24</p>
<p>On expiry of even one day (after the 8th month), the 9th month till the 10th month is said as the period of parturition.</p>
<p>This is the limit of this period, overstay of the fetus in the womb is abnormal.</p>
<p>Sa4#25</p>
<p>Thus the fetus grows and develops in this order in the womb.</p>
<p>Sa4#26</p>
<p>The fetus develops in the womb due to the excellence of the procreative factors– mother etc., excellence of mother&#x27;s conduct, proper mechanism of <strong>&#x27;upasneha (nourishment) and upasweda (heating)&#x27;</strong> from the mother, passage of time and natural phenomena.</p>
<p>Sa4#27</p>
<p>The defects in the procreative factors- mother etc. lead to the absence of birth of the child.</p>
<p>Sa4#28</p>
<p>The factors contrary to those responsible for the development of the fetus as said above cause it&#x27;s destruction in the womb <strong>or premature delivery</strong>.</p>
<p>Sa4#29</p>
<p>Now I will explain how the factors, though not destroying completely, cause morbidity in fetus.</p>
<p>When a woman uses aggravating factors, the doshas get vitiated and in course of spreading reach the ovum and uterus but do not affect them entirely.</p>
<p>She conceives but the fetus gets damaged in one or more maternally derived organs; that part is affected with morbidity in the gene, wholly or partially, of which the doshas are vitiated.</p>
<p>When in it&#x27;s ovum the gene concerned with uterus is damaged, the progeny becomes sterile; when a part of this gene is affected, a putrefied child is born.</p>
<p>When alongwith the latter abnormality a portion of the genes concerning the female characters relating to body is also affected, the progeny will be predominantly female-shaped, but not female actually. This person/ condition is called &#x27;varta&#x27;.</p>
<p>These are the morbidities due to affection of the female genes.</p>
<p>Sa4#30</p>
<p>Likwise, when the genetic part of the sperm in male is affected, the child will be</p>
<p>sterile.</p>
<p>When a fraction of the genetic part is affected, putrefied child will be born.</p>
<p>When alongwith the latter morbidity, a fraction of the genetic part relating to male body characters, the offspring will be predominantly male-shaped but not male actually and named as &#x27;Trnaputrika&#x27;.</p>
<p>These are the genetic defects concerning male.</p>
<p>Sa4#31</p>
<p>Thus by the above description of the morbidity relating to maternally and paternally derived organs, that relating to the organs derived from suitability, nutrition and psyche may also be taken as having been described.</p>
<p>Sa4#32</p>
<p>The absolute self is devoid of abnormality and characters in all beings, hence the characters are found only due to specific features of psyche and body.</p>
<p>Sa4#33</p>
<p>There are 3 doshas in body– V, P and K.</p>
<p>They affect the body.</p>
<p>Two are the doshas in psyche– rajas and tamas.</p>

<p>[Here follows information on pages 435-439 about different types of minds/ personalities.]</p>
<p>[It probably does need to be copied into the book, but check book I to make sure.] [affirmative; it will be added to &#x27;mind&#x27; chapter]</p>
<p>Thus the entire topic of the descent of the life principle into embryo is explained as proposed earlier. The full knowledge of this topic leads to observance of the entities which are conducive to fetus and elimination of those which are liable to damage it.</p>
<p>Sa4#41</p>
<p>Now the summing up verses–</p>
<p>5 useful topics– cause, self, source of origin, gradual development of fetus in the womb and it&#x27;s cause, the damaging factors and the cause leading to the absence of birth , destruction and morbidity– all this is said in this major chapter on descent into embryo. The former 5 and the latter 3 are called as auspicious and unauspicious factors respectively. The physician who knows fully all these 8 entities is able to work for the king. He, with broad intelligence, should know the means of formation of the fetus and also the factors which damage the same.</p>

<p>[The following is from a couple of pages on the Fetus.] Sa 6</p>
<p>Agnivesha said– I heard whatever you said about the body. (Further kindly enlighten us as to) what part of the fetus arises first in the womb?</p>
<p>How does it lie inside the womb and whither faced?</p>
<p>On what food is it sustained?</p>
<p>In what state does it come out?</p>
<p>By what food and management does it die immediately after birth?</p>
<p>By what does it grow being free from disorders?</p>
<p>Whether it is affected by the disorders caused by wrath of gods etc?</p>
<p>What is your view about the existence or non-existence of timely and untimely death?</p>
<p>What is it&#x27;s maximum life-span?</p>
<p>What are the factors leading to maximum life-span?</p>
<p>Sa6#20</p>
<p>After Agnivesa finished his queries, Lord Punarvasu said– it has already been said in the chapter on the descent into embryo as to how it arises in the womb and what organs appear and when?</p>
<p>(Regarding your first query) There are various types of controversy among the sages who composed the aphorisms.</p>
<p>Now understand what I tell you.</p>
<p>&quot;In the womb, head manifests first&quot;- This is the view of Kumarasira Bharadwaja because that is the seat of all the sense organs.</p>
<p>Kankayana, the physician from Bahlika, says– &#x27;Heart (arises first) because it is the passage for ingestion of nutrition.</p>
<p>Bhadrasaunaka said– &#x27;Ano-rectum arise first because they are instruments of the person.</p>
<p>Janaka from Videha said– &#x27;sense organs (arise first) because they are the seat on knowledge.</p>
<p>Marici Kawyapa said- &#x27;it is incomprehensible because of it&#x27;s being out of direct observation.</p>
<p>Dhanwantari said– &#x27;all organs appear simultaneously.</p>
<p>The view of Dhanvantari is correct because all organs such as heart etc. appear</p>
<p>simultaneously.</p>
<p>All organs of the fetus are rooted in the heart and also some other entities are located there, there can be no appearance of other entities earlier than heart so simultaneous appearance of all organs preceded by heart is concluded.</p>
<p>All entities, in fact, are inter-linked so they should be viewed with correct perspective.</p>
<p>Sa6#21</p>
<p>The fetus lies in the womb facing towards the mother&#x27;s back, with head upwards and limbs folded.</p>
<p>Sa6#22</p>
<p>The fetus, without hunger and thirst, depends for it&#x27;s maintenance entirely on mother by the mechanism of unction and heating in the uterus during the stage of incomplete manifestation.</p>
<p>Thereafter some unction is performed through the passage of hair follicles and partially through the path of umbilical cord.</p>
<p>The cord is attached to the umbilicus, placenta is attached to the cord on one side and to the mother&#x27;s heart on the other.</p>
<p>Mother&#x27;s heart floods the placenta (with nutritive fluid) through the pulsating blood vessels.</p>
<p>That nutrition provides strength and complexion as it contains all essential factors.</p>
<p>IN pregnant woman, nutrition takes 3 courses– first for the nourishment of her own body, the second for lactation and the third for the growth of the fetus.</p>
<p>Sustained by that nutrition, it carries on within the womb (dependent on the mother).</p>
<p>Sa6#23</p>
<p>The fetus, when the moment of delivery is approached, by taking turn becomes below-headed and comes out of the genital track.</p>
<p>This is normal, otherwise is abnormal.</p>
<p>Hence-forth he becomes independent for his maintenance.</p>
<p>Sa6#24</p>
<p>His diet and management as mentioned in the chapter in the &#x27;principles of procreation&#x27; prevent disorders and promote the growth of fetus.</p>
<p>If these two are not properly observed the offspring dies immediately after birth <strong>as the newly planted tree with it&#x27;s root un-stabilized is destroyed by the wind and the sun</strong>.</p>

<p>V vitiated by it&#x27;s vitiating factors such as intake of rough food etc. reaches the seat of milk (breast) and affects the taste of milk.</p>
<p>So the milk affected with V has abnormal taste.</p>
<p>The child gets reduced while taking it, does not relish it and grows slowly.</p>
<p>Similarly the vitiated V churning the milk inside produces excessive froth and as such the breast milk flows out with difficulty.</p>
<p>By taking it the child suffers from feebleness of voice, retention of stool, urine and wind, or V head disorder or coryza.</p>
<p>Ci30#239-241</p>
<p>V vitiated as above, dries up the unctuousness of the milk. Thus the child by taking the rough milk gets debilitated. Ci30#242</p>

<p>P vitiated by intake of hot etc. reaches the seat of milk [the breast] and produces abnormal color therin [of the breast only/ of the breast and milk/ of the milk only] such as blue, yellow, black etc.</p>
<p>The child suffers from abnormal complexion, perspiration, thirst, diarrhea and constant fever and does not welcome the breast.</p>

<p>K vitiated by intake of heavy etc. while reaching the seat of milk makes the milk too unctuous due to unctuous nature.</p>
<p>By this the child suffers from vomiting, tenesmus, and salivation.</p>
<p>Due, in this same condition, to the channels being constantly smeared, it is associated with sleep and exhaustion, dyspnea and cough and excessive discharge and feeling of darkness.</p>
<p>When K predominates and makes the breast milk slimy, the child taking it suffers from salivation, swelling of face and eyes and dullness.</p>
<p>K, due to heaviness while reaching the seat of milk causes heaviness in milk. By taking such milk the child gets heart disease.</p>

<p>In such cases, in order to purify the breast milk, first of all, the wet-nurse should be uncted and fomented properly and then treated with emesis.</p>
<p>For this, she should be administered the decoction of nimba and patola salted and added with the paste of vaca, priyangu, madhuyasti, madanaphala, kutaja and sarsapa.</p>

<p>He who knows to administer them properly in disorders is a real knower of Ayurveda. -all the above Su1#74-76</p>
<p>The 16 plant drugs having useful roots are: hastidanti, haimavati, syama, trivrt, adhoguda, saptala, swetanama, danti, gavaksi, jyotismati, bimbi, san[k]apuspi, visanika, ajagandha, dravanti and ksirini.</p>
<p>San[k]apuspi, bimbi and also haimavati are used for emesis.</p>
<p>Sweta and jyotismati are useful for head evacuation.</p>
<p>The remaining 11 are useful for purgation.</p>
<p>Su1#77-79</p>
<p>The 19 plant drugs having useful fruits are: sankhini, vidanga, trapusa, madana, dhamargava, iksvaku, jimuta, krtavedhana. Two types of klitaka- aquatic and terrestrial, prakirya, udakirya, apamarga, haritaki, antahkotarapuspi, autumnal fruit of hastiparni, fruits of kampillaka, aragvadha and kutaja.</p>
<p>Dhamaragava, iksvaku, jimuta, krtavedhana, madana, kutaja, trapusa and hastiparni– these may be used for emesis and asthapana basti (non-unctuous enema).</p>
<p>Apamarga is prescribed for nasal evacuation.</p>
<p>The remaining 10 are used for purgation.</p>
<p>Su1#80-85</p>
<p>Fat is of 4 types: ghee, oil, muscle-fat and marrow. <strong>&quot;They are used respectively for intake, massage, enema and snuff.&quot; [So, they are used as follows:]</strong></p>
<p><strong>ghee- for intake (eating) oil [i.e., sesame oil]- for massage muscle-fat- for enema marrow- for snuff</strong></p>
<p>These fats are mentioned as promoting unctuousness, vitality, complexion, strength and development and alleviating V, P and K.</p>
<p>Su1#86-87</p>
<p>The 5 salts: Sauvarcala (<strong>obtained from plants</strong> like suvarcala etc.), saindhava (rock salt), vida (<strong>obtained from [animal&#x27;s] excreta</strong> [feces/ urine]), aubhida (obtained from earth) along with samudra (obtained from sea water) are the 5 salts.</p>
<p>They are unctuous, hot, sharp, best promoters of agni (appetite and digestion) and are used in paste, oleation, fomentation, purgative, emetic, non-unctuous and unctuous enema, massage, food, errhine [nose cleansing]], surgical measures, suppositories, collyriums and annointings for indigestion, anaha [[a type of indigestion]], vata, gulma, sula [[general pain]] and udara [abdominal disorders].</p>
<p>Su1#88-89</p>
<p>The 8 urines: these are the primary urines discussed in the Charaka Samhita. They are: urine of sheep, goat, cow, buffalo, elephant, camel, horse and ass. In general, urine is sharp, slightly non-unctuous, pungent-saline (in properties) and is useful in anointing, pasting, non-unctuous enema, purgatives, fomentations, for anaha, poisoning (in agadas), udara, arsa, gulma, kustha and kilasa and also in unguents and sprinkling. This is also promoting appetite and digestion, antipoison and antihelmintic and most beneficial for those afflicted with panduroga. It pacifies K, carminates V and draws P with purgation. This is the general description of the properties of all urines. Now they will be described individually:</p>
<p>Sheep urine: is slightly bitter, unctuous and non-antagonist of P. Goat urine: is astringent-sweet, beneficial (for the channels) and alleviates (all) dosas.</p>
<p>Cow urine: is slightly sweet, somewhat alleviates dosas, destroys krimi and kustha, removes itchings and, taken internally, is beneficial in udara caused by tridosa.</p>
<p>Buffalo urine: is slightly alkaline, laxative and alleviates piles, sopha [[sothaedema??]] and udara.</p>
<p>Elephant urine: is salty, beneficial for patients of krimi and kustha and commended for retention of urine and feces, poisons, disorders of K and piles.</p>
<p>Camel urine: is slightly bitter, destroyer of dyspnea, cough and piles. Horse urine: is bitter-pungent and destroyer of kustha, wounds and poisons. Ass urine: is destroyer of epilepsy, insanity and grahas (seizures). Su1#90-104</p>
<p>The 8 milks: the milks are of sheep, goat, cow, buffalo, camel, elephant, mare and human women. In general, milk is sweet, unctuous, cold, galactogogue, refreshing, body-promoting, spermatogenic, intellect-promoting, strength-promoting, mindpromoting, vitalizer, fatigue-alleviating, destroyer of dyspnea, cough and internal hemorrhage; union-promoting in injuries, wholesome for all living beings, pacifier (of dosas), eliminator (of malas), destroyer of thirst and appetizer. This is the most useful in ksina (weakness, wasting), ksata (injuries), anemia, gastritis, emaciation, gaseous tumor, abdominal enlargement, diarrhea, fever, burning sensation, edema, specifically in disorders of female genital tract, semen, deficiency of urine, hardened stool and conditions of V-P. Milk is everywhere used in snuffing , pasting, bathing, emesis, nonunctuous enema, purgation and unction. Properties of individual milks are described in the section on specific foods and drinks.</p>
<p>Su1#105-113</p>
<p>Now there are other 3 trees having useful latex [[sap]]: snuhi, arka and asmantaka which are different from the plants of phalini [fruit] and mulini [root] groups. Asmantaka is known for emesis, latex of snuhi for purgation and latex of arka for both emesis and purgation.</p>
<p>Su1#114-115</p>
<p>There are also 3 other trees having useful [[bark]]: putika, krsnagandha and tilwaka tree the barks of which are beneficial. Putika and tilwaka are used for purgation, krsnagandha for parisarpa (erysipelas), odema, piles, ringworm, abscess, glands, skin diseases and alaji.</p>

<h1>On Primary and Secondary Drugs in a Formula:</h1>
<p>When a drug is combined with a main drug, the formulation is named after the latter one .</p>
<p>This is the normal pattern.</p>
<p>In such formulations, madanaphala etc. are main and sura etc. as subsidiary ones. The latter follow the former as the people follow the king.</p>
<p>Ka12#43-44</p>
<p>Even if the subsidiary drug possesses contrary potency, it does not create any obstacle in the activity of the main drug.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the former is similar in potency, the effectivity of the latter is enhanced.</p>
<p>Ka12#45</p>
<h1>Use of Supportive Drugs of Contrary Potency For Balance/ Palatability in a Formula:</h1>
<p>In every disorder, because of consideration of providing the agreeable color, taste, touch and smell the usage of drugs contrary in potency is almost certain.</p>
<p>Ka12#46</p>

<p>The main drugs should be further potentiated by impregnating them with their own juice.</p>
<p>This is because even a small drug, if impregnated well, exerts multiple actions. Hence one should impregnate the drugs with their own juice or the juice of the drugs similar in potency.</p>

<p>The wise physician should eliminate the drug if it is not appropriate even if enumerated in the group and should add the appropriate one even if it is unmentioned. (F the situation arises) a group may be combined with another or several other groups based on reasoning. This aphorism, though small, is able to provide wide knowledge to the wise like alms of a mendicant or seeds of a farmer. The aphorism for the wise, gives rise to critical analysis and reasoning while for the dull, it is better to follow the saying exactly. The physician following the said course succeeds in his endeavor or causes little risk because of the illustrations being not too brief.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="drasticity-of-evaucative-measures">Drasticity of Evaucative Measures:<a href="#drasticity-of-evaucative-measures" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Drasticity of Evaucative Measures:" title="Direct link to Drasticity of Evaucative Measures:" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>now listen about the features of drastic, medium and mild evacuative measures.</p>
<p>That purgative or non-unctuous enema is said as drastic which acts easily, quickly, with great impulse and unimpeded.</p>
<p>It eliminates the entire impurity without producing excessive malaise, pain in anus and heart and damage to the intestinal tract.</p>
<p>Ka12#51-52</p>
<p>The drug attains drasticity if <strong>it is uncontaminated with</strong> water, <strong>fire</strong> [does this mean, for example, that uncooked herb will be stronger? I reckon so] and organisms, is endowed with properties on account of proper palace and time, administered in somewhat higher dose and impregnated with (the juice of) drugs similar in potency and the patient is properly uncted and fomented.</p>
<p>Ka12#53-54</p>
<p>The drug exerts medium action if it is somewhat devoid of the above qualities and also in lower dose and the patient is properly uncted and fomented.</p>
<p>Ka12#55</p>
<p>The drug acts mildly and with feeble impulse if it is of low potency, in lower dose and combined with drugs dissimilar in potency and <strong>the patient is excessively rough</strong>.</p>
<p>Ka12#56</p>
<p>Medium and mild drugs are defective for strong person as they do not eliminate the entire impurity.</p>
<p>However, they are to be used in cases of patients having medium and inferior strength with a view to achieving success.</p>
<p>Ka12#57</p>
<p>The disease is also grouped as severe, medium and mild when it has all, medium and few symptoms respectively.</p>
<p>Thy physician considering the severity should administer drastic, medium and mild drugs respectively in these conditions.</p>
<p>Ka12#58</p>
<p>If the impurity is not eliminated by the emetic drug administered earlier, it should be given again and again till bile is observed (in the vomit).</p>
<p>Ka12#59</p>
<p>One should administer the drug again or avoid totally after assessing the 3 types of strength of dosa (morbidity) and the diseased.</p>
<p>Ka12#60</p>
<p>If the emetic drug after being administered comes out or is digested (without eliminating the impurity) another drug should be administered to achieve good result.</p>
<p>Ka12#61</p>
<p>* The emetic drug eliminates the impurity while undigested and the purgative one does this while being digested.</p>
<p>Hence one should not wait for the digestion of emetics.</p>
<p>Ka12#62</p>
<p>If a purgative drug, after being taken gets digested without eliminating the impurity or is vomited, the physician should administer the drug again.</p>
<p>Ka12#63</p>
<p>If the patient is not evacuated properly and has good digestive power, plentiful impurity and firm qualities of unction he should be given diet on the same day and drug on the next day.</p>
<p>Ka12#64</p>
<p>If the patient is debilitated and has plentiful impurity and has purgation due to maturation of the impurity, he should be given laxative edibles to promote the purging.</p>
<p>Ka12#65</p>
<p>If one is not fully evacuated by emesis and purgation, his remnant impurity</p>
<p>should be pacified by administering proper diet and decoction.</p>
<p>Ka12#66</p>
<p>One should administer mild drug to the patient who is weak, evacuated earlier, has little impurity and unknown about the nature of bowels.</p>
<p>Ka12#67</p>
<p>It is always safer to take mild drug repeatedly which has little trouble and is free from complications rather than the over-drastic drugs which create quickly the apprehension of death.</p>
<p>Ka12#68</p>
<p>The patient having plentiful impurity even if debilitated should be purged frequently but mildly with mild drugs because the non-eliminated impurity may cause his death.</p>
<p>Ka12#69</p>
<p>If the purgative drug after being taken goes upwards having been associated with K, the patient should be vomited, cleansed with gargles, lightened and then again given the drug [for downward purgation].</p>
<p>Ka12#70</p>
<p>In case there is constipation and the impurity is discharged in little quantity and with delay, the patient should drink hot water.</p>
<p>By this tympanitis, thirst, vomiting and constipation are pacified.</p>
<p>Ka12#71</p>
<p>If the drug obstructed by the impurity moves neither upwards nor downwards and produces belching and pain, fomentation should be applied.</p>
<p>Ka12#72</p>
<p>If the patient is purged well but has eructations, the drug should be vomited quickly.</p>
<p>Ka12#73</p>
<p>In case, there is excessive elimination even after the drug is digested, it should be checked with quite cold measures.</p>
<p>Ka12#73</p>
<p><strong>&#x27;Sometimes the drug obstructed by K stays in the chest which moves down in the evening or night when K is diminished.&#x27;</strong></p>
<p>Ka12**#74**</p>
<p><strong>In rough or fasted patient if the drug after digestion produces distension and goes upwards with V, another drug may be taken mixed with uncting substance and salt.</strong></p>
<p>[This is happening typically in modern P.K. clinics.]</p>
<p>Ka12#75</p>
<p>In case there appear thirst, mental confusion, giddiness and fainting during digestion of the drug, P-alleviating, sweet and cold measures are recommended.</p>
<p>Ka12#76</p>
<p>In case of covering due to K where there are salivation, nausea, distension, horripilation, sharp, hot, katu and other K-alleviating measures are beneficial.,</p>
<p>Ka12#77</p>
<p>If the patient having been uncted well and with hard bowels is not purged well, he should be lightened.</p>
<p>By this his natural K and obstruction are removed.</p>
<p>Ka12#78</p>
<p>In case of rough, one having predominance of V, hardness of bowels accustomed to physical exercise and with stimulated digestive fire, the drug gets digested without exerting the purgative effect.</p>
<p>Hence in such cases, at first enema should be given followed by purgative.</p>
<p>Thus the purgative quickly eliminates the impurity impelled by the enema.</p>
<p>[This is a common problem now.]</p>
<p>[This is a clever and useful solution.]</p>
<p>Ka12#79-80</p>
<p>In persons having rough diet, habitual exercise, stimulated digestive fire, the impurities get diminished by physical exercise and exposure to wind, sun and fire and they also tolerate untoward effects of incompatible food and intake of meal when the previous meal is not digested or during indigestion.</p>
<p>These persons should be protected from V with unction and should not be evacuated except in illness.</p>
<p>Ka12#81-82</p>
<p>The person having not been uncted profusely should be given unctuous purgative.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if the person has been uncted excessively, he should be given a rough purgative.</p>
<p>Ka12#83</p>
<p>Thus the wise physician conversant with place, time and measures administering the evacuative drug to the proper subject according to method does not fail.</p>
<p>Ka12#84</p>
<p>That which is applied wrongly acts as poison.</p>
<p>That which is applied rightly acts as nectar and is to be taken essentially in (prescribed ) times should be administered cautiously.</p>
<p>Ka12#85</p>
<p>Whatever dose of drugs is mentioned in this context relates to average state of bowels, age and strength.</p>
<p>The variations may be done taking this as base line with plus and minus in individual cases.</p>
<p>Ka12#86</p>
<p>[Note: when preparing herbal oils or other herbal decoctions, it is preferable to use herbs which are not powdered finely, since they are easier to strain out of the oil or decoction than fine powder is. In other words, chopped herbs are usually preferable to powdered for preparation of oil or decoction.]</p>

<h1>Definition of &quot;Emetic&quot;, &quot;Purgative&quot; and &quot;Evacuative&quot;:</h1>
<p>Emetic: Drug which eliminates impurity from the upper part [of the body, through the mouth].</p>
<p>Purgative: Drug which eliminates impurity from the lower part of the body, via the anus.</p>
<p>Both Emetics and Purgatives come under the title of Purgative or Evacuative because of their general action of purging out the &quot;excrements&quot; [impurities] of the body.</p>
<p>Ka1#4</p>

<p>The hot, sharp, penetrating, pervading and loosening drugs because of their potency reaching the heart [/the deep cardiovascular channels/reserves] and circulating through vessels effect the mass of impurity in the entire body, liquefy it out through large and small ducts due to fiery nature and disjoin it due to sharpness.</p>
<p>Consequently, the disjoined mass floating in the uncted body like honey in and uncted vessel reaches the stomach due to the penetrating nature [of the drug] and being propelled by udana V is thrown up because of the natural composition of the drug with agni and vayu (mahabutas) and the specific potency (for emesis).</p>

<p>[Purgative drugs also cause the same process of liquefying and mobilizing the impurities which is described above for emetic drugs.]</p>
<p>But when the natural composition of the drug predominates in jala [water] and prthvi [earth] and there is specific potency [virya/vipaka/prabhava] (for purgation), it goes down.</p>

<p>&quot;Here I will describe 600 evacuative formulations in respect of madanaphala, jimuta, iksvaku, dhamargava, kutaja and krtavedhana (all emetics); syama, trivrt, caturangula, tilvaka, mahavrksa, saptala, sankhini, danti and dravanti (all purgatives) for the purpose of guidance to way of variations though there are innumerable combinations of drugs due to variations in habitat, place and time; taste, rasa, virya, vipaka and</p>
<p>prabhava (of drugs); in body, morbidity, constitution, age, strength, agni, inclination, suitability, states of disease etc. (of the patient) and in smell, color, taste and touch (of vehicles and subsidiary drugs) for easy administration. - Ka1#6</p>
<p>These drugs are the most potent ones when they are endowed with strong potency due to excellence of place, time, properties and containers.&quot; - Ka1#7</p>
<h1>Use of [Anupan (administration vehicles- adjuvent herbs] for Medicinal Herbs [probably especially for emetic herbs]:</h1>
<p>These drugs should be administered with vehicles according to dosa, such as:</p>
<p>In V:</p>
<p>Wine, sauviraka, tusodaka, maireya, medaka, dhanyamla, phalamla, sour curd etc.</p>
<p>In P:</p>

<p>There is no antagonism of honey to heat [being heated in the formula? The heat of pungency of the rest of the formula? The heat of the pathological P which is being</p>
